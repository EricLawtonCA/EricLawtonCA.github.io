<p>This blog is mostly a commentary on the contents of the site and the changes I make to it, in order to further illustrate the way my thinking evolves, as I update the contents of the workbook.
</p>
<p>
It also includes some thoughts about the news which are relevant to the workbook.
</p>
<p>
I might post some of my photography, just to make things interesting and provide some lighter content.
