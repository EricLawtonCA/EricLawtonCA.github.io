	<h1>About Eric Lawton</h1>
	<p>Eric has led a complicated life. </p>
	<p>	Many people defined themselves by their career, I have
      had several jobs and a career in social work, followed by one in Information Technology,
			starting as a programmer and finishing as an Open Group certified Distinguished Lead Architect.
	</p>
	<p>Others define themselves by nationality. I am now down to two because Brexit has deprived me of European
		 citizenship, so I now hold British and Canadian citizenship. I don't really consider myself to be any of "British",
		 "Canadian" or "English". I'm not a nationalist or even a patriot, for reasons explained in the workbook.
	</p>
	<p>I am a white male. I don't need to define myself by either of those identities. That happens automatically in most
     contexts, and there's a lot of truth in that, but it's not altogether correct either. Again, more in the workbook (eventually)
	</p>
