# About Eric Lawton

Part of my message in this work is that we see things from our own viewpoints, which bring their own perspectives, so here is a quick introduction to my background as a partial explanation of my viewpoints.

I have led a complicated life.

Many people defined themselves by their career, I have had several jobs and a career in social work, followed by one in Information Technology, starting as a programmer and finishing as an Open Group certified Distinguished Lead Architect, in the role of Executive IT Architect, which meant I was technical lead on large scale ($100 million plus) projects, or acting as adviser to industry executives, mostly in government, covering environment, social services, health and more.

I have studied several subjects at university, at undergraduate and graduate level: mathematics, physics, philosophy and computer science. I also took the advice of Martha, one of Doris Lessing's characters in her "Four-Gated City" novel, the one that I have read the most. That is to do the equivalent of at least one undergraduate course every semester. That has added up to quite a few subjects, including social sciences, biology, history, economics and systems in a variety of fields beyond information systems. I have recently finished an online course in Indigenous Studies from University of Alberta which, coincidentally, is one of the universities that I have studied at both as a grad student and undergraduate.

I am now retired and getting used to the idea of being a senior citizen with its consequences.
Others define themselves by nationality. I am now down to two because Brexit has deprived me of broader European    citizenship, so I now hold British and Canadian citizenship. I don't really consider myself to be any of "British",  "Canadian" or "English". I'm not a nationalist or even a patriot, for reasons explained in the workbook. However, it does mean that I have an obligation to hold the Canadian government to account as much as possible as well as the Ontario provincial governments. I mostly do so by pestering my representatives by email and phone. I

I am a white, cis male. I don't need to define myself by either of those identities. That happens automatically in most contexts. Part of the point of this workbook is to help me understand what that means and I am grateful to the many people who are not white cis males who have been kind and patient enough to help me see a few of my mistakes. All those that remain are my responsibility to change.
