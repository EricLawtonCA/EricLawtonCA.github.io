I ran out of money for my old Wordpress site, didn't like the idea of investing too much into a Google site, so thought I'd try here.

Yes, I know GitHub is now owned by Microsoft but I'll try for a bit and it's possible that next year I'll be able to find time and $ to shift my domain registration from GoDaddy and find a more politically acceptable place to host my lofty thoughts.

My intent here is to create a philosophy workbook; a work in progress which will develop into a book but will show the reasoning that went into building it.

The blog will document the progress and thoughts that won't go into it, as well as random thoughts on the world, me, and
whatever catches my fancy
