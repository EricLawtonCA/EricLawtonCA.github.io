It took me a whole year to get anything done on here, but now I have a bit of content for my workbook.

It is still very much a work in progress but maybe some feedback will help clarify my thinking.

Since I went so long, I forgot a lot of what I knew of HTML and CSS so it is very plain for now, mostly written in Markdown until I think I need to do something fancy.

Just click on the Workbook menu item to get started. The other menu items should be obvious, though I haven't checked their contents recently.

I have almost 90,000 words written but not posted

Some is just in need of tweaking for format and navigation aids so now I've got back to posting, new content should appear soon. But the rest is still early draft so will need a few more weeks.

I'll post here what is new and what is changed, and why I changed it. This whole exercise is iterative, or dialectical if you like fancy philosophical words. As I develop ideas, they begin to expose contradictions so I have to go back and fix either my thinking tools, my values or research the facts some more.

As mentioned in the Introduction, I haven't figured out the best way to give feedback, so for now, Twitter is best, either in response to specific tweets or with the hashtag #EricsWorkbook for general comments. My apologies if you don't use Twitter, but I understand it will soon allow you to log on with other IDs such as Google or Apple. I don't really want totally anonymous comments (pseudonyms are fine) so even if I go for something like Disqus, you'd need an ID for that.
