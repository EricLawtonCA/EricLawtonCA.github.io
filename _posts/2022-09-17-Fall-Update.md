I've finally been able to get back to this after family illness and *hope* to be able to continue with more frequent updates. I've added a couple of workshops and improved the introduction.

The need to take on more around the house dashed hopes of nature and garden posts, or even of gardening, though I recently managed to clear space for a vegetable garden next year.

However, I did a little work on the main workbook, over the summer. Most of it was re-thinking material I had already written and restructuring to attempt to make things clearer. This is obviously going to be a long-term, iterative effort.

My framework is helping a little to structure my thinking; it has survived all but some minor tweaks in the diagrams and their descriptions.

It hasnâ€™t yet shown a lot of power in the text I have on here, but it has provoked some of my detailed rethinking and, more importantly, provoked a lot of notes that will fit into later workshops.

I think I've been fussing too much with the sequence of workshops and may have to do it again, so I won't point to specific new workshops here, and since there hasn't been anything new here since May, nobody will remember anything, so you may as well start at the main [Table of Contents](/workbook/index)
