I have written a little more in my writing tool (Scrivener), but haven't published any of it for a long time ― since August and it is now November ― but am finally getting round to it.

Partly because I am nervous about publishing it. I may have made a lot of errors and I hate being shown to be wrong in public, though the best way to fix that is to let it loose on the world and find out how to correct my errors. So please comment via Twitter; my DMs are open until and unless this provokes a lot of nonsense. As Ambika Kamath said recently on Twitter, reply but assume I'm somewhat intelligent.

Partly because I got so far behind and publishing is not an easy task, especially when I've forgotten the easiest workflow after so long.

There is still a lot more to publish, and even more to fix before publishing and even more still to write.

I am finding the exercise worth while. I have found a lot of mistakes already, just by forcing myself to think hard, which requires writing because I the only way I know to think critically about complex topics.

The main thing I have learnt so far is that systems thinking in the popular books and what I have written so far is not yet capable of being used to design human systems or to predict what existing systems will do, but that it can be useful for a form of story telling; this is still a very useful thing to do, as an antidote to the overly simplistic, sloganeering ideologies being peddled by politicians and corporate apologists.
