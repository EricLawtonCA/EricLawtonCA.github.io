# Why read this #
The world is in a mess.

As I write this, we are in the midst of a pandemic which has been made far worse than it needed to have been because of failures of political leadership and, far worse, people in power who do not care about consequences so long as they hold on to power.

We are in the midst of a climate crisis, brought on by the emissions produced by the economic system which dominates our production of goods and services, and a mass extinction on a scale comparable to those caused by catastrophic events like meteor strikes or massive volcanic explosions.

We are seeing continued genocide of Indigenous people and cultures wherever these survive.

We are seeing increasing divisions between people as white supremacy and neoliberalism increase their visibility and spread hatred of people who aren’t white, aren’t straight, cis men, are disabled or aren’t “Christian” by their perverted definition.
We’re seeing more nations and sub-national bodies sliding away from democracy, even in the limited form they have practised until now.

The global economy is making a very small number of people extremely rich, with long life expectancies, while the majority of people are seeing little or no improvement in their lives; they live in poverty, in poor health, with minimal education often through many generations.

The people in power or granted significant privilege are excluding the majority of people both through manipulative techniques addressed to potential supporters and directly through racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry and other systemic barriers. Liberal Democracy is retreating from the already small foothold it had on political life. These massive injustices are supported by ignorance at best, and often by hatred and by violence.

We spend vast sums of money on organizations and weaponry for war or internal oppression, which reflects a vast diversion of material resources, expertise and work-hours that would be far better spent on improving peoples’ lives than on finding ever more expensive ways of killing them, imprisoning them or forcing them into debt through fines.

Everyone seems to agree that we are subject to a flood of misinformation though there are significant disagreements over which is genuine information and which is not. It seems that what some people believe is driven more by loyalty to the people whose brand they like than it is by any rational process. The misinformation is clearly deliberate and goes beyond a few lies. It is bullshit --- nonsense with an attempt to deceive. We need ways to counteract that.

However, the misinformation goes far deeper than that. Modern life in the Eurocentric[^fn1] world, the world I live in, is based on a series of complex institutions. These institutions form interlocking, complex systems which are difficult to understand but which are portrayed as somehow almost optimal. Although they have resulted in all the issues listed above, and many more, we are led to believe that all the alternatives are somehow much worse. We are told that, imperfect as things are, we still live in the best of all possible systems and that at worst we only need some tweaks and reforms to fix the problems above.
On the other hand, there are many who say that these systems are themselves the cause of the problems; that capitalism and colonialism lead inevitably to those problems. That we cannot halt the changes to the environment or eliminate poverty without replacing the systems. There are many suggestions as to what we should replace them with, but they are not in agreement. Nor are they in agreement as to how it should be done, yet the situation is urgent.

My purpose in writing this is to think through what is going on, to remove the falsehoods that have become stuck in my mind through the environment I have live in, so that I can make better decisions on who to support and how to do so, in the struggle to improve things. I have learned many mental tools for analysis and design through my education and professional practice, and personal contacts, as well as fairly wide reading.

I find that by writing things down, re-reading critically and reworking, I expose a lot of errors in my thinking. This removes false assumptions that I have somehow acquired and improves my understanding of the tools I use for the analysis. Sometimes ways of thinking that work well on a small scale do not work so well on a larger scale.

By adapting some ways of thinking that I have found useful in understanding the world and designing smaller systems (a few hundred million dollars), and comparing the results with the real world, I can see if they are useful in understanding larger systems and, if so, how to change them.

The reason you may benefit from reading is that you may find my analysis useful, or perhaps just the tools I use. Or maybe you will just learn from my mistakes.
We may also both benefit from mutual collaboration. For the more complex problems that face us, the thoughts of individual thinker are of little value. They require more interdisciplinary, system-level thinking and acting than any individual is capable, even if the individual makes no errors which is impossible. As H.L. Menken said

> For every complex problem, there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.

Unfortunately, those answers are easy for politicians to sell, so we need to arm ourselves against them.

My view of the world is that it is better if we work towards the common good, which at minimum includes ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to have a fulfilling life, with their basic needs for life, health, food and shelter met, regardless of the circumstances of their birth or the accidents that befall them through life. I think that we are social beings, so that community is as important as individuals. We cannot thrive without community any more than the liver can thrive without the rest of the body. If you are in general agreement with this, then you may find some of this useful.

This is aimed at readers who recognize the injustice in the world and wants to change that.

It will be of no value to people who are strong supporters of populist politicians, who are anti-immigrant, who think Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ2S+  or any other group currently excluded from privileges are inferior or should give up their identity and assimilate or to anyone of similar beliefs.

It won’t help you if you believe that individual rights trump all social needs or that your particular subset of humanity is somehow superior to others, whether that is based on some concept of race, gender, sex, religion, ability, nationality or similar attributes, unless you are open to persuasion that such beliefs are false.
These exclusions are because experience suggests that such people are too committed to their beliefs for it to be likely that they will change their minds, though I will eventually provide some reasons why, even by their own standards, they are wrong to hold these beliefs. Perhaps some will change their attitudes.

Many other people are doing more important work in organizing change, have far deeper knowledge than I do of particular situations and have developed or adapted their own thinking tools. I offer my collection of tools as something I have found useful so far and am developing further through writing this. They are yours to use, adapt or discard. Feel free to let me know if they are useful or not, through my Internet contact points. Even if this workbook is not useful for those doing the work, I hope that this will be of some use in encouraging people at least to avoid being obstacles to necessary change and perhaps even to learn enough to join the efforts to change things.
