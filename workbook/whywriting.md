# Why I am writing this and why you might want to read it #
The world is in a mess.  We are in the midst of a deadly pandemic and climate and biodiversitiy crises, but people are resisting the means to end them; we have an illegitimate political system which claims to be a democracy but excludes most people from most decisions; we are continuing the genocide of Indigenous peoples, yet white people are wilfully ignorant because we benefit from it; fascism is rising again; although we have more information and knowledge widely available than ever before, yet it is often behind paywalls and overwhelmed by a flood of misinformation, lies and propaganda, to name but a few.

This is the result of deliberate choices made by powerful people that are made in order to maintain their wealth and power, rather than to create systems that will provide a better life for most of us.

We must change this, and we can.

These are my thoughts towards understanding our current situation and how we can change it for the better. I am an old, white, cisgender man, living on stolen land under the claimed jurisdiction of a state called Canada. I have been educated and socialised in a colonial, capitalist, representative democracy. It takes work to understand how the system works and --- since this system maintains itself by bombarding those within it with propaganda in its favour --- it takes work to see its fundamental flaws and to find ways to overcome them.

I am working on two main aspects, though like most concepts they are not fully distinct: the intellectual tools which I use during the thinking and the results of applying those to my subject matter which are mainly humans in Eurocentric[^fn1] societies and the institutions we have built. You may find either of these useful or interesting. Even when I make mistakes, I find them instructive when I realise where I have gone wrong.

You, too, might find it instructive. My path through life has been different from yours and so my collection of thinking tools is different. We are all more limited beings than we usually acknowledge but one of the ways we can overcome our individual limitations is through sharing and collaboration. Indeed, I would be delighted to collaborate with anyone who would like to, initially via my Twitter account @eric0lawton.  In "collaborate", I include strong, reasoned criticism, but not insults or mere contradiction. I realise that Twitter is not a good medium but we can find another channel if you are interested.

My purpose in writing this is to think through what is going on, to remove the falsehoods that have become stuck in my mind through the environment I have live in, so that I can make better decisions on who to support and how to do so, in the struggle to improve things. I have learned many mental tools for analysis and design through my eduction, professional practice, and personal contacts, as well as fairly wide reading.

I find that by writing things down, re-reading critically and reworking, I expose a lot of errors in my thinking. This removes false assumptions that I have somehow acquired and improves my understanding of the tools I use for the analysis. Sometimes ways of thinking that work well on a small scale do not work so well on a larger scale.

By adapting some ways of thinking that I have found useful in understanding the world and designing smaller systems (a few hundred million dollars), and comparing the results with the real world, I can see if they are useful in understanding larger systems and, if so, how to change them.

Collaboration has two main benefits. The first is that two brains are better than one, the second is that for the more complex problems that face us, the thoughts of individual thinkers are of little value. They require more interdisciplinary, system-level thinking and acting than any individual is capable, even if the individual makes no errors which is impossible. As H.L. Menken said,

> For every complex problem, there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.

Unfortunately, those answers are easy for politicians to sell, so we need to arm ourselves against them.

My view of the world is that we are social beings. That means that it is better both for ourselves and for others that we have to care for each other as individuals and that we design and cultivate the social systems we live in, in a way that allows everyone to thrive.

Working towards the common good is as fulfilling as working to achieve personal wealth and power that exceeds those of other people, in the bizarre belief that, which at minimum includes ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to have a fulfilling life, with their basic needs for life, health, food and shelter met, regardless of the circumstances of their birth or the accidents that befall them through life. I think that we are social beings, so that community is as important as individuals. We cannot thrive without community any more than the liver can thrive without the rest of the body. If you are in general agreement with this, then you may find some of this useful.

This is aimed at readers who recognize the injustice in the world and wants to change that.

It will be of no value to people who are strong supporters of populist politicians, who are anti-immigrant, who think Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ2S+  or any other group currently excluded from privileges are inferior or should give up their identity and assimilate or to anyone of similar beliefs.

It won't help you if you believe that individual rights trump all social needs or that your particular subset of humanity is somehow superior to others, whether that is based on some concept of race, gender, sex, religion, ability, nationality or similar attributes, I don't intend to spend much time arguing that these beliefs are false; there is plenty of evidence that this is so. However, many of the discussions that follow will support this conclusion.

These exclusions are because experience suggests that people with these beliefs are too committed to their beliefs for it to be likely that they will change their minds, though I will eventually provide some reasons why, even by their own standards, they are wrong to hold these beliefs. Perhaps some will change their attitudes.

Many other people are doing more important work in organizing change, have far deeper knowledge than I do of particular situations and have developed or adapted their own thinking tools. I offer my collection of tools as something I have found useful so far and am developing further through writing this. They are yours to use, adapt or discard. Feel free to let me know if they are useful or not, through my Internet contact points. Even if this workbook is not useful for those doing the work, I hope that this will be of some use in encouraging people at least to avoid being obstacles to necessary change and perhaps even to learn enough to join the efforts to change things.

If you do find any of this useful, I guarantee you will find writings by people who have been marginalised by the power structures and accompanying personal attitudes in the dominant systems in the eurocentric world to be even more useful, including Indigenous, racialised, LGBTQ+, disabled and more. Their perspectives are more valuable than mine. I was not brought up to realise this, so I am still having to listen carefully, with both imagination and diligence to what they have to say, because my world-view tends to be self-perpetuating and reinforced by the systems I live in. Sometimes what I am told doesn't fit with what I think I know at the time, so I have to take on trust for a while that it makes sense when I am able to change my perspective.

However, so far it has been worth the effort. I often feel uncomfortable to learn that I have been wrong, but it's far better than continuing to be wrong.
