<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Why I am writing this</h2>
<p> This is a work of philosophy, which means “love of wisdom”.
  I don’t claim to be wise, but I am writing this in the hope of becoming wiser.
  It is, therefore, a personal work, but if you share at least a few basic points of view with me,
  it may help you to do some similar work to the same end.
  Philosophy is a complex discipline with many areas of specialization,
  but it also contains many tools and techniques that have a general applicability.
  My main interest is in applying them to understanding our social world and how we can improve it.
  It is meant to be practical philosophy.  I mostly want to answer practical questions that we need to answer
  in order to live well as human beings, in today’s context, the early 21st century.
  And since this context is currently bringing a series of avoidable bad things to millions of people,
  such as intergenerational poverty, massive inequality, pollution, institutional bigotry such as racism,
  shrinking democracy, the rise of nationalism and the droughts, floods and ecosystem destruction
  that is brought by global heating, the answers must come both in changing ourselves,
  individually and the systems that we have created that are the underlying causes of these problems.
  Since one of my areas of expertise is in designing systems, this work will focus at least as much on systems
  as on individuals which has been the focus of the majority of traditional ethics.
</p>
<img src="/images/overview.gif" alt="Concept map, described in detail in text">
<p>One of our biggest underlying problems is that our current systems are quite obviously built to benefit a very small number of social predators who control our most important systems. These system are powerful because they are the background to everything we do; they are harmful because they are the root cause of the crises we are facing. </p>
<p>They are sustained in spite of this because they are built on bullshit (BS). I use this word in Merriam-Webster’s sense of “to talk nonsense, especially with the intention of deceiving or misleading” , as exemplified by the public relations industry and US president Trump. This works because individual humans have limited capacity both mentally and in available free time, especially when their attention is constantly co-opted by a barrage of misinformation designed on scientific principles to do so. And life is far too complicated to leave people with the additional time and mental capacity to solve both immediate personal problems and to solve more systemic problems.</p>
<p>It is obvious that BS broadly underpins the economy because a large amount of the global economy is built on advertising, an industry that has been refined over a century or so to persuade people to buy things through increasingly sophisticated, scientifically based, techniques of persuasion. In some jurisdictions, outright lying is discouraged through the use of advertising regulations, but deception and misleading through omission or through indirect implication is common. This is not a failing of individual companies, but a foundational, systemic failing. The competitive nature of the market place means that no company can succeed if its advertising were straightforward, honest claims about the advantages and disadvantages of its products or services, providing the public with the facts needed to make a rational choice.</p>
<p>Outside the products of the commercial advertising, marketing and public relations industry, politicians bullshit all the time. Again, this is not an individual failing but a systemic one. Electoral politics uses the same techniques of persuasion. The current President of the United States is notorious for his BS, not even feeling the need to be consistent within a single speech, let alone between tweets. The division of many legislatures into two main political parties, which in parliamentary democracies on the British model is actually designates two parties as the party of government and the official opposition often results in the second party spending a lot of its time and resources in attacking the governing party at every turn, claiming that they are at best misleading the public, so that it is clear that one party or the other is quite wrong on every issue.</p>
<p>One keystone lie is that individual self-interest in free markets will lead to an optimal economy. The more we reduce regulations and progressive taxation on “free markets”, the more we see concentration of wealth in a very few, the more we see pollution on both local and global scales and the more we see exploitation of low-paid workers in dangerous conditions. It is so plainly in the best interest of the wealthy to see deregulation and low taxes that it is remarkable that so many people believe it.</p>
<p>This is one place where philosophy has a role to play. One of the branches of philosophy is called epistemology, the theory of knowledge: how do we know what is true and what is not.</p>
<p>Another main branch of philosophy is ethics, the theory of what we ought to do or what is the right thing to do, which includes providing reasons for why we ought to do things. These reasons should provide the foundations for us doing things, giving our actions a purpose. We often lose track of these purposes as we focus on more immediate needs.</p>
<p>Most philosophy books deal with the knowledge and purposes of individual humans. This one will also deal with these questions on an institutional level. We already treat many of them as at least metaphorical persons. Some (corporations) are even treated as such in law. They are far more powerful than any individual, yet they are mere abstractions that we can remake as we wish. Because many of them also exist much longer than any human, some changing more slowly than is easily visible, others changing so fast that it is difficult to keep track, we should be spending far more at least as much time on ensuring the the design of those institutions is ethical as philosophers traditional do on ensuring that humans are ethical.</p>
<p>The fact that we live our lives as part of systems that change fairly slowly, so that we are unaware of the fact that the systems are not inevitable and they are not the best possible systems, they generally benefit the rich and powerful. We tend to believe that they are generally beneficial because the systems have evolved methods to convince us of that. Otherwise they would not have survived so long. Since the system of most impact in the Eurocentric world is capitalist colonialism and the ideas that make it seem much more benign have taken over  much of our mental real estate, the process of eliminating these alien ideas can be called “decolonizing your mind”. </p>
<p>I follow the news and opinion media quite frequently and I often see politicians giving their opinions, along with scientists, economists, entertainers, business executives, historians and many others. Academic philosophers hardly ever appear, though there are many so-called pundits who unfortunately are not learned in Hindu philosophy, as the term meant originally. Many of them are chosen as much for their entertainment value as for any real expertise.</p>
<p>Does this make philosophers and philosophy useless? I don’t think so. I have found it to be one of the most useful subjects I have studied. But the value for me is not that it can, by itself, provide a set of conclusions on practical matters but that it provides a collection of mental methods and tools that complement the other disciplines I have studied or the practical experiences I have had. In my case that includes mathematics, physics, computing, systems design, social work and even managing a grain elevator. We can arrive at better conclusions if we combine the methods and tools of philosophy with the method, tools and information of other disciplines, from all ways of life.</p>
<p>These philosophical tools are used in several ways. They can be used to win arguments through defending your position or attacking the opinions of opponents; they can be used in collaborative discussions to help a group arrive at a decision but most usefully, they can be used to examine your own thoughts in an attempt to steer them more towards something like wisdom. There are no real boundaries between these three, they are more a matter of emphasis. You only make yourself look foolish if you persist in an argument that you have clearly lost; it is better to change your opinion, even if you feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>My philosophical education was mostly in the English-speaking analytic philosophy schools, so my toolkit is biased towards that tradition, but I have acquired some from other traditions. Since I am sharing this with you, I welcome any perspectives you may have, from any source. I have also added to that some ideas on systems thinking which have not been taught in courses on philosophy but which I learned as a designer of systems, and ideas on modeling, from the same source.</p>
<p>The expertise I gained in these specific ways of thinking, from the professions I have practised, can be made more general and applied to the crises that are becoming ever more urgent across the planet as well as to more personal issues. </p>
<p>I have also, since retirement, had the opportunity to listen to people from very different backgrounds than mine, who see the world in very different ways. It has become obvious to me that the interpretations of the world that I learned in school are not an accurate picture of how things are and that we urgently need to replace those myths with better ones, or the results of the coming changes will be that things get much worse instead of, as is still possible, much better.</p>
<p>The urgency of doing this comes from the fact that our climate and biological systems social and economic systems are about to collapse, dragging along the biological and climate systems we depend on. Many of us are already dying in heatwaves, or migrating because of drought or famine. Although there is not currently a crisis from the small number of migrants heading to North America from South America, or from the Middle East to Europe, as nationalists pretend, this will get far worse. And part way through writing this, the CoVid-19 epidemic has struck, leading many to see the gaping holes in our social and economic systems as many of their underlying premises are challenged.</p>
<p>I will show that current social and economic systems are significant contributors to the problem, possible irreparably so, so we will be considerably better off if we build entirely new ones. </p>
<p>However, history suggests that there will be too much misery, death and destruction if we follow the path of most revolutions. There is an enormous risk that all that will happen is that a different, even more violent, group of powerful men will take control without creating a better system in any way. Somehow, we have to do renovation in place, which will be a difficult task. Still, we have, at least temporarily, learned how to fight terrible diseases, grow enough food to feed everyone and make a huge proportion of the collective knowledge of humanity available to everyone.</p>
<p>Like any other human being, I have very limited powers of reasoning and, although I know how to find a vast amount of information if I need to, I actually only have a tiny fraction of it immediately accessible to my reasoning powers at any specific time. However, also like any other human being, my knowledge and skills are different from yours and I have focused them on different issues, so if we can combine our perspectives as we work together to create a better world. I would certainly be interested in yours if you want to discuss on social media or through comments on my web site.</p>
<p>I don’t know if any of my answers are workable but I am more confident that at least my questions have value in showing that things are not what we are led to believe. Since our entire economy is built on misleading people (”advertising”) and many of our politicians are at best completely mistaken<span style="text-decoration:underline;">*</span><a id="fnlink1"></a><a href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> or at worst lying, it should not be surprising that we have been misled in significant ways. One problem is that there is so much noise, so many demands for attention, that it is difficult to understand what is important and what is not. I propose some candidates for obvious and important</p>
<p>For example, although the architects of our current liberal economies have insisted that the best way to build our social institutions is to rely on markets to deliver what we need automatically, with no attempt to control the process at all. They insist on that even though it has clearly failed, because of the disasters we can see unfolding and because a few centuries of attempts at market economies have done nothing to eliminate systemic racism, ableism, homophobia, poverty and many other ills, and that the most “successful”, adherent to this ideology has among the highest murder rates and incarceration rates in the world.</p>
<p> Even though they tell us repeatedly that free markets produce better results than planned organizations they do not believe it themselves. Why else would they have built such large, centrally controlled, hierarchical corporations?</p>
<p>We are on the brink of environmental collapse through climate change and other causes of mass extinction such as habitat destruction also pose great danger and our social and economic systems are failing to respond with the changes we need to avoid disaster. In fact they are structured in such as way that they have caused the problems and cannot easily be changed to less harmful systems. Such a change would be fundamental to the point that they would no longer be capitalism or the form of mock-democracy we currently have.</p>
<p>Some politicians, who are currently in power or at least have a powerful platform, are dividing us through bigotry, fear and hatred of minorities and migrants, which is leading to more conflict. Nationalism is again becoming a divisive force and the now enormous wealth gaps are historically unprecedented,</p>
<p>The last time Western nations became so xenophobic in outlook, we had a world war. On previous times we had similarly gaps in wealth and power, we have had revolutions. If we have another such large-scale outbreak of violence, the impact will be far worse, because not only do we risk far more direct damage from our far more destructive weapons, the impact on the environment of the greenhouse gases cause by the use of the weapons and their delivery systems is likely to be as catastrophic as the direct death toll and the damage will far outlast the war, probably by centuries. Unless we have significant use of nuclear weapons, in which case it won’t even matter that we have a few years of nuclear winter before warming returns.</p>
<p>Some of these issues are so urgent because we are close to making things irreparably worse, in spite of the fact that we have most of the knowledge, skills, resources and technology we need to avoid or mitigate the risks and, where we do not, we have the ability to develop much of it in the near term. What we lack is the wisdom and the will to do what needs to be done, so I call this work “practical philosophy”, not because I think it is wisdom, at least not yet, but because I hope it is work towards that.</p>
<p>We need immediate, practical action to address these issues, yet we also need to take the time to think about what to do, so that we don’t inadvertently make matters worse, which has happened several times during past revolutions. </p>
<p>This is a contribution towards finding the right balance of thought and action. I have no illusions that I have answers to the problems I have mentioned, but I will suggest some practical mental tools for thinking about systemic problems, that I have found useful and hope they can be used more broadly to analyze practical issues suggest possible courses of action and ways they can be validated and improved, or discarded.</p>
<p>Human beings, you and I included, are far from the most intelligent entities on the planet. This is because we have created some artificial intelligences that are far more intelligent and powerful than ourselves. These are not software on digital hardware, at least not yet,they are institutions such as nations, corporations, governments, organized religions, Science, universities, armed forces and more. It is helpful to think of them this way, because we have designed them that way, and some even have rights similar to or even greater than actual human persons. Some of these, as they currently stand, are evil, some are good and they are mostly under the control of humans, though to some extent they are less so than many people think.</p>
<p> One of the themes of this workbook is that we need to redesign our institutions so that they work for the benefit of everyone, through an iterative approach of Monitoring, Analyzing, Designing and Implementing (MADI) them. By “thinking”, I mean a collaborative work of many people, not just philosophers in armchairs, though they can contribute. The institutions I refer to should be designed to harness their intelligence to goals that benefit everyone by making it possible for people to collaborate in deciding what to do and in doing it. Humans didn’t get to the moon through a few solitary genius rocket scientists, but through the collaboration of thousands through a well-designed NASA institution, which in turn collaborated with universities, engineering firms, parts suppliers and more.</p>
<p>In this workbook, I examine how this approach can make a contribution towards tackling the problems of bigotry, climate emergency, mass extinction and other urgent problems of our times by providing tools, techniques and skills that can help solve practical problems, while reducing the risks of making significant mistakes, but that the existing “democratic” capitalism can do no such thing. Worse, it prevents those who want to live in other systems, such as Indigenous Nations throughout the world from developing their traditional systems because capitalism has always destroyed those who want to live otherwise because its current design demands it.</p>
<p>One aspect of this is a set of thinking tools that I find can be applied to multiple problems. I will explain some of those I have found useful, illustrate their use with “toy” problems and then attempt to apply them to bigger issues. The issues are complex and, like all humans, my brain is very limited, so I will make many errors, but I hope people will catch them and let me know.</p>
<p>Another aspect is the “armchair-thinking” phase of sitting back and trying to see things as a whole and of also trying to look closer and finding errors in thinking that sometimes come from being too invested in a particular discipline’s ways of thinking, so expect to find a mix of traditional philosophy, science, history, politics, economics and more.</p>
<p>A third aspect is that of “life philosophy”, often introduced by the phrase “My philosophy is…”. It is a person’s overall approach to living, or some fast guidance for thinking in a hurry. Of course, it should be far more complicated than that and a collection of aphorisms will be needed, hopefully consistent. For example, my philosophy is to celebrate everyone’s individuality and culture, unless they are a danger to others, in which case it is permissible to use minimal means to prevent harm; punching Nazis included”. In a more extended sense it is the collection of attitudes and thinking tools that a person regularly relies on.</p>
<p>Philosophy by itself isn’t much use in proving that things are true. Most grand theories put forward by philosophers have been proven false or at least dubious enough that it would be irresponsible to depend on them to guide actions. But it is useful in showing that beliefs are false and, given that the dominant social, political and economic structures are based on lies, that is useful in itself.</p>
<p>I hope that it is obvious to you that our current systems are based on lies. If not, just consider that the services of the Internet giants and broadcast media are provided to the general public free to us, but paid for by advertising. Very little of it is full, factual information. Much of it is not directly false, because there are some laws about truth in advertising, but it is often very partial and is misleading, or simply meant to push your psychological buttons. And politicians? They lie directly. This is obvious because the main parties in countries that permit more than one party directly contradict each other on factual matters. You can’t rationally believe all of them.</p>
<p>This workbook will show why the system is so irreparably bad that we must replace it and will provide some ideas on how we can do that while causing the least amount of harm to the most vulnerable people. It is only the start; I hope it will promote dialogue among those of us who want to solve these problems. We can only do it as a community. Perhaps we can even find a way that the most vulnerable benefit from the changes as we make them, rather than in some distant future “after the revolution” during which, many will suffer great harm, to judge from earlier revolutions.</p>
<p>I will suggest approaches for combating the outrageous lies that have been used to build and justify the current system, enabled by the billions of dollars spent by the advertising industry on research into effective ways of persuading us into acting against our interests. This advertising industry is so enormous that it supports all of the “free” Internet services and so many of the facts that reach us are paid for by advertising and so intermingled with advertising.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we live in a world where we have access to more facts than ever before, through the effort in research institutions to discover more knowledge, through the access to the knowledge of other cultures through the Internet, through investigations of reporters and other organizations and through gathering and publication of many kinds of fact on the economy and environment through government and other organizations. But when that knowledge is mixed with misinformation of all kinds, from commercial advertising to political persuasion and Internet trolls and bots, this mixture both increases the credibility of the advertising and decreases the credibility of the factual content.</p>
<p>Much of this misinformation is crafted as words and images designed to persuade us to think in certain ways and do certain things. Most of them are crafted to “push your buttons”, to use psychological tricks to embed phrases and images in your brain so that you will buy products or support the social and political ends of the people paying to do this. Some are very obvious, but this does not necessarily stop them from working. Some are far more subtle.</p>
<p>Because our current systems are built on persuasion and lies, tinkering with them will not work. We need principled, radical action to help us change the system for the better, or replace them. It may be too late to avoid violence, which may be coming no matter how much we want to avoid it, but we may be able to limit it and we may be able to put something in place that will reduce the amount of violence that we have to endure in the future.</p>
<p>Critical thinking by itself is not enough. It can only show errors in reasoning. Other foundations are required, including facts and values. Facts are the domain of other disciplines, primarily science and history. Values come from human experience. Facts, values and logic are interdependent since there are no facts free of value or theory, no values are sure without examination and logic is sterile without facts. But even these are not enough if, as in most philosophy, we stick to individual thinking. Humans are social animals and all of our thinking is mediated through the formal and informal institutions in which we are embedded. We need to look at the design of these institutions and how we can change them to tackle the problems we are facing.</p>
<p>This workbook is my attempt to think things through and look for a path to a world that is considerably better than this one. I know that I can’t do that by myself; people with more knowledge and wisdom than I have tried, but I hope that by sharing my thoughts it will stimulate more thinking and doing among like-minded people and that we can work our way through it together.</p>
<p>By “like-minded”, I mean people who think that all other people matter, that we should deal with each other with love, honesty, fairness, compassion and tolerance and that the truth matters. If this is you, it is possible that rest of this work is for you and when I say “we”, I am usually referring to you, me and all others who think and feel this way. Unfortunately, there are people who are so far from agreeing with this that we may never be able to treat them as other than toxic.</p>
<p>I know that most people will never change their minds about some things, that they are so certain of their beliefs that any counter-argument will be met with anger, starting with insults and possibly violence. This includes some of the very dangerous political opinions which are now being voiced by those in power or that may well gain power in the near future. At some point, we have little choice but to refuse to tolerate the intolerant and use force to prevent them from doing harm. I am under no illusions that anything I say will reach them, but I will explain why I think that we can find ways to change most of them.</p>
<p>Of course, I have my own core beliefs, that I hope I will never give up. If you disagree with more than a few of them, this work is not for you. To save you the trouble of reading further, those things I do not tolerate include any variety of fascism, white supremacy or other bigotry. There are no arguments that can persuade me that denying the humanity of people of colour, of women, of people with any peaceful religious belief, of LGBTQ+ people or of different cultures is justified, or that such people should be treated with any less respect than any others.</p>
<p>Even though there are no arguments that can immediately persuade people that their core beliefs are wrong, that is not to say that people, including myself, do not change their minds about them. However, the means are rarely, initially, rational arguments on an individual level. I will discuss this later in more detail. For now, recall how the populations of whole nations change as they attempt to mobilize for crises such as war or as they emerge from those crises; how relatively liberal people become Nazis or how the rank and file of Nazis become liberal again following military defeats.</p>
<p>Our political and economic systems are failures on every level. They may have generated vast wealth, but have concentrated it in the hands of a very few; a dozen or so people “own” more wealth than the poorest billion or so. There are no reasonable arguments that somehow these few dozen have worked as hard or as skilfully as over 100,000,000 other people combined. And they are a direct cause of the environmental disaster we face. If we are to survive, we have to replace the systems.</p>
<p>This will requires a mix of practical politics, informed by the sciences and humanities; in short, wisdom.</p>
<p>Wisdom can be defined as</p>
<p> “The quality of being wise, esp. in relation to conduct and the choice of means and ends; the combination of experience and knowledge with the ability to apply them judiciously; sound judgement, prudence, practical sense”</p>
<p> Shorter Oxford Dictionary</p>
<p>which I think is useful. I hope this will be partly apparent through this work, though I only claim to be wiser than average on days when the local electorate make what I think is a disastrous choice of leader and government. (Or on bad days on Twitter 🙂 ).</p>
<p>I intend this to be practical philosophy, in two senses.</p>
<p> It will be more applicable to everyday life, rather than being primarily of interest to professional, academic philosophers, though they may also find it of interest.</p>
<p> It will focus a lot on ethics, which has been called practical reason by well known European-derived philosophers such as Kant, because ethics is reasoning about what we ought to do, which is directly related to our practise in life. </p>
<p>It will include not only small-scale personal ethics but also social ethics – how we should structure society and its institutions in an ethical manner.</p>
<p>Every day, I decide to do things which affect other people. I think I should have regard not only to my own needs and desires, but to the needs, desires and rights of other people. In short, to act ethically. I don’t always act do so, but I do try to spend some time thinking about the implications of my actions and changing my habits to get a better balance of doing the right thing and doing things that are just for myself, or friends and family.</p>
<p>There are many people who not only do not act ethically, but have no intention of doing so. If that is you, you are wrong, if only because you are not as happy as you would be otherwise. However, you will need to learn about psychology and social psychology to understand why. Feel free to come back here once you’ve done that. Otherwise, there is little point in your reading any further. There are also many people who think they act ethically but do not. That includes all of us on occasion, but some are almost entirely wrong, because they do not understand the concept at all.</p>
<p>I take it as a starting point that our degree of respect, love and kindness from their fellow humans should not be based on differences in skin colour, gender, culture, ability, wealth, intelligence, strength or on much more than how their behaviour affects other people.</p>
<p>Since ethics is the practise of reasoning about what is right and wrong, what we ought to do, I think it is an important topic that should be taught at every level of every school. It is surely not ethical to teach people how to do things, without also teaching them how to decide whether they should even be doing such things, or how they can work out how to live a good life.</p>
<p>Although I have studied philosophy at a graduate level, this is not meant to be a formal work of philosophy. Professional philosophers do not appear to be wiser than other mortals, or behave any more ethically than academics in other departments, nor is there any better behaviour among those specializing in ethics. Studying ethics without it affecting your personal life seems to be an admission that you have missed the point entirely. That is why I left the academic study of philosophy, but I have continued to use the tools I acquired and to learn more. I won’t employ any academic jargon unless I feel it really helps, and I will explain it as well as I can. I also won’t include as much historical philosophy, though I will point to some of the sources that I still lean on, in case you want to explore further.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of human beings that I think are very important but are missing from many other works of popular philosophy.</p>
<p> Individual humans are very limited beings. We are not capable of reasoning things out in full, quickly enough to act, and we do not have all the data we need to understand the consequences of our actions. Grandiose theories of ethics that require things like calculating the benefits of actions for years into the future or for all people are useless.</p>
<p> Human beings are embedded in cultures and institutions. We don’t think for ourselves, we absorb a lot of thoughts ready-made from the cultures we live in and are constrained by the infrastructure, physical, cultural and institutional that we live in. Demands for individual freedom, exempt from the constraints of those cultures, are as pointless as a bird demanding freedom from the friction of the air. </p>
<p>Philosophy as a discipline rarely agrees on a conclusion. Unlike science, there could never be a headline “Philosophers say…” because there is rarely consensus on anything. There are as many opinions on anything as there are philosophers. And the topics such as “free will”, “the meaning of life”, “the nature of reality” rarely seem to have much to add to the decisions we have to make every day. I will spend a little time on some of the more esoteric questions that have interested philosophers over the millenia, but those will be in separate sections and and meant mostly as exercises to refine the methods I use for more practical questions.</p>
<p>I am publishing it as I write it, on the Internet. So it will change as I realize my mistakes and attempt to fix them.  This is a workbook, an attempt to document my approach to philosophy, my understanding of the world and some ideas on how to change it.</p>
<p>It will never be finished because both my thinking and the world continue to evolve, thought there may be a version that I abandon if there is no interest in it.</p>
