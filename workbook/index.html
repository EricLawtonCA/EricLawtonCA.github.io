	<h1>Philosophy Workbook Table of Contents</h1>
  <p>This is very much a work in progress. I have barely started with laying out the website, though I have 90,000 words of content.
		  </p>
	<p>	Since the structure is evolving fairly quickly, I am not building fancy navigation for now but keeping this table of
	contents in one place. I'll sprinkle breadcrumbs and other aids once I go a few weeks without restructuring.
  </p>

	<p>The top levels are intended (for now) to be complete but I find I am changing them rather often. I have lower level content in Scrivener, the tool I use for writing anything more than a few
		pages, unless it needs live code embedding in which case, RStudio Notebooks.
		However, it needs a another draft before I amd ready to publish here.
	</p>
	<p> Major headings in black aren't intended to have content, leaf levels that have content have links in grey that you can click, others will be completed as soon as I can.
		Start with <a href="whywriting">Why read this?</a> to get some sense of what this is about and where it is going.
