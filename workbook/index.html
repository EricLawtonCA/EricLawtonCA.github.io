<h1>Philosophy Workbook</h1>
<p>This is a work of non-academic philosophy, by which I mean only that it is my attempt to think things through on subjects of social and political philosophy, in a way that I hope is accessible to others who may wish to do the same thing. It is a workbook in the sense that I am actively working on the thinking, by way of exercises ― workshops ― at the end of which, I try to learn and document some lessons and possibly rework the workshop, though I also have a section at the end where I will eventually document the "corrected" results so that I can leave the instructive mistakes in the workshops as reminders.
</p>

  <p>This is very much a work in progress. I have barely started with laying out the website, though I have 90,000 words of content in my primary writing tool, which is Scrivener.
  </p>

	<p>The top levels are intended (for now) to be a complete set but I find I am changing them rather often.
	</p>

	<p>Lower heading levels that already have content can be reached by following their links in yellow.
  Others will be linked when I am ready to publish them.
	</p>

	<p>	Start with <a href="whywriting">Why read this?</a> to see what this workbook is about and where I hope to take it.

<h2>References</h2>
  This will not, unfortunately, be a full set of references as in scholarly works, because I no longer recall where I got a lot of my thinking from. But there will be some recommended reading, more comprehensive once I decided I needed to track this better.
