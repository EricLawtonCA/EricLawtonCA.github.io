<h1>Philosophy Workbook</h1>
  <p>This is very much a work in progress. I have barely started with laying out the website, though I have 90,000 words of content.
		  </p>
	<p>	Since the structure is evolving fairly quickly, I am not building fancy navigation for now but keeping this table of
	contents in one place. I'll sprinkle breadcrumbs and other aids once I go a few weeks without restructuring.
  </p>

	<p>The top levels are intended (for now) to be complete but I find I am changing them rather often. I have lower level content in Scrivener,
		</p>
	<p> Major headings will not have content, except for the brief description that follows them in this table of contents. The lowest heading levels will eventually have content and those that already have content can be found by following their links in yellow, others will be completed when I am ready to publish them. I expect to have several more in the next week.

  This will not, unfortunately, be a full set of references as in scholarly works, because I no longer recall where I got a lot of my thinking from. But there will be some recommended reading, more comprehensive once I decided I needed to track this better.
