<h1>Philosophy Workbook</h1>
<p>This is a work of non-academic philosophy, by which I mean only that it is mostly about tools for thinking about a particular topic, in this case human social systems, in a way that I hope is useful to others who may wish to do the same thing.
  </p>
<p>It is a workbook in the sense that I am actively working on the thinking, by way of exercises ― workshops. At the end of each one, I try to learn and document some lessons and update the last section which is a reference manual for the tools.
  </p>

  <p>This is very much a work in progress. I have barely started with laying out this website, though I have 90,000 words of content in my primary writing tool, which is Scrivener.
  </p>

	<p>The top levels are intended (for now) to be a complete set.
	Lower heading levels that already have content can be reached by following their links in yellow. Those without links are placeholders until I am ready to publish them.
	</p>

	<p>To dive right in, start with <a href="Intoduction/Rationale/thepointofitall/whatisthiswork">What is this work?</a> to see what this workbook is about and where I hope to take it.
