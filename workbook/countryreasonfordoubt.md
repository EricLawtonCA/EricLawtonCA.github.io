# First workshops on Sovereign States
The Earth is divided into sovereign states. This was not designed for our good and there are reasons to believe it is not.
In this series workshops, I lay a foundation for understanding this system of systems and either justify the claim in the title or persuade myself otherwise.

## Problems with Countries

The land on the Earth is currently divided into a set of patches of land together with a margin of sea around the land, except for Antarctica and a few small disputed patches. The United Nations recognizes each of these, together with an institution for each patch which it recognizes as the sovereign government of that patch, including everything in it, including all its people.

As I start this workshop, this appears to be a bad idea from the point of view of most humans. The primary evidence is the enormous amount of spending on the military which is driven and enabled by the size of the larger economies. In 2020, the total world military expenditure was about US$2 trillion. Even worse is that they are used against people other , causing death and misery on a huge scale.

This in itself is reason enough to rethink the system. There are alternatives. Think of federal states, like the Canada or the UK. Scotland does not need to arm itself against England or Wales. For that matter, there is little fear in the near future that one EU country will invade another, in spite of their bloody history of doing just that. Indeed, this was one of the primary reasons for forming its predecessor organizations shortly after World War II.
