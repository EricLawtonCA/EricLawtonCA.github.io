### Values and requirements

If we are to make things better, whether changing ourselves or our social systems, we need to know what we mean by “better”. We need some agreed criteria by which to judge them. These can take many forms. We need them at many levels of scope, whether they are global or for a neighbourhood book club. They may need a wider scope than agreement within the group itself; unless you are a nazi, you should agree that neighbourhood book clubs should not exclude people based on race. I’ll leave it as an open question for now about whether a local soccer team should exclude people based on gender.

At a smaller scale, principles and rules need not be recorded in any form, at an intermediate level they can be written or embedded in stories and interpreted by people recognised within the community as having such authority. At a wider scale, it is more practical to have them written to make it easier to communicate, discuss and change.

At a level of countries, all have written laws. Some have written constitutions that take precedence over and are more onerous to change than ordinary laws.

The countries and other institutions that do have formal constitutions usually have some preamble that summarises the overall principles. For example, France includes its famous slogan of “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity”, from their revolution (though the last might be better rendered as “Community” to avoid gender bias).

The American Declaration of Independence states that they “hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness”, which also seems reasonable.

Although they may seem self-evident, they are far from clear and not followed literally; the USA has the death penalty, an enormous prison population and millions living in poverty and sickness that does not seem to allow a very vigorous pursuit of happiness. Clearly people accept that there are limitations, although the USA seems to have gone to extremes in the number of  exceptions.

If there are to be exceptions to these principles, we obviously need some reasons for those exceptions, or they are so arbitrary as to be useless.
As well as these national declarations, international declarations such as the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples also start with some abstract, high-level principles.

The United Kingdom does not have a written constitution, it has a hodgepodge of laws that have been made over centuries but are based on no formal principles, though some have been recognised by the Supreme Court including including parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy, and upholding international law[ See, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom]. This stems from the continuous evolution of government, rather than a revolution, although some key documents such as Magna Carta came from the threat of revolution or key principles such as a Bill of Rights and the supremacy of Parliament over the Monarchy from a relatively bloodless show of force (“The Glorious Revolution”). The courts, especially the recently created Supreme Court[ Itself evolved from the House of Lords.] have found it necessary to abstract these principles from the mass of declarations, charters and law, in order to give  broader guidance to lower courts than a huge mass of individual documents to consult for every case.

All this supports the utility of some general, broadly agreed principles, while providing some caution on how these are to be interpreted. They may be written as a single general vision on how things could be if we tried, but this has to be supported by several general principles to act as specific guidance for decision-making.

When evaluating specific systems, or designing new ones, more detailed  requirements must be specified. These can’t always be fully met, either because of costs or conflicts with other requirements from the many interested parties. They will need to be prioritised. Classifying them as “needs” (must have) and “wants” (strongly desired but not absolutely necessary) is often a useful start to this.

I hope it is clear that defining values is difficult. It is especially so when values are in strong conflict and especially when some of the interested parties  prefer violence to reason. On the other hand, we don’t need to rely on them being “self-evident” or being handed down by a creator, we can develop them through human processes.

I hope to address this more in workshops on this topic, once I have developed some tools for the job. I don’t intend to attempt a better job than national or international leaders in defining values and requirements, but to suggest some methods of evaluating them.
