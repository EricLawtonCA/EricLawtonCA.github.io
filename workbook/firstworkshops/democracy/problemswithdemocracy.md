# First Workshops on Democracy
  A first round of workshops on eurocentric democracy, introducing some basic problems, initial definitions and a view of eurocentric democracy as a system.

## Obvious problems with Representative democracy

Democracy is supposed to be a good thing because it gives everyone an equal say in the important decisions that affect us all.

In practice, it fails on several counts.

The first count is that in actual practice, the policy resulting from legislatures is heavily biased towards the wants and needs of particular groups of people. For example, in several studies in the USA  [Vox, 2015-06-13: These graphs show the veto power of white men in politics](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/13/8768773/white-men-politics-influence), actual policy changes are driven primarily by the views of one demographic group: white men.

>State policy changes reflect men's preferences but not women's. Using slightly different methodology, Stephanopoulos compared states' overall ideological bent (as measured by actual policies enacted) to the bent of different demographic groups within the state. As this graph shows, women's political ideology has almost no effect on states' overall leanings.

(My emphasis).

> As support for a policy increases in black communities, “the likelihood of the policy’s adoption stays constant at best, and in fact may decline somewhat”.

Another papers cited in this article shows that

> Compared to people with incomes both at the bottom 10th and 50th percentile, those with incomes in the top 10th percentile were significantly more likely to see policies enacted that they approved of in cases where there's major rich-poor disagreement.

It is particularly obvious in the US that wealth buys power, but it seems to apply in other eurocentric democracies.

The second count is that democracy is very limited in scope. We are constantly hearing demands for “small government” and “privatisation” because, supposedly, private businesses will make more efficient decisions. But that means many decisions having great effect on us are being taken with no consultation of the majority of people. Decisions made by the market, whether “free” or controlled as it is now by oligarchs are the opposite of democracy, as long as we have unequal wealth. At present, the scope of decision-making by government is very limited.

A third count is the lack of accountability. This is primarily because we vote for people, not policies. The people run on three grounds: what nice people they are, what a great party they represent and what excellent policies they argue for during the election. The first two should be irrelevant as far as most people are concerned but they have no obligation to actually implement any of the policies they claimed to support. There are absolutely no consequences until the next election even if they do the exact opposite immediately on election. And as I just noted, they supposedly represent the voters, but they do not, they represent their party. I get frequent mailings from my MP, but they are all about his party’s policies. Even in response to, for example, my letter to him about the dreadful state of rural Internet services in our riding, he explained his party’s policy on cell phone coverage, with nothing about what he could do about being able to get enough bandwidth to stream video.

Another reason is that power in government is very concentrated. It is a little different in the US where the executive and the legislature can sometimes be at loggerheads, but the current situation under Biden, with a bare majority in the House and Senate appears to have to give way to the minority party on many initiatives. What is clear is that power is concentrated in party elites and  that both limits the choices of the electorate and concentrates it in fewer hands. For a UK example, see “The Establishment and how they get away with it” by Owen Jones.

In parliamentary systems, where the executive is part of the legislature, power has been increasingly concentrated in the executive [^fn1]. . Since the Prime Minister has power of appointment of all other government positions, they have enormous control over the rest of the executive since they can be hired and fired at will, as well as many other patronage appointments. The current situation in the UK where the Prime Minister has been proven guilty of criminal offences and of misleading Parliament over “Partygate”, yet is refusing to resign and is so far able to avoid political consequences until someone else is able to build a coalition of MPs strong enough to oust him.
