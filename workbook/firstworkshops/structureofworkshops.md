# Workshops

## How the workshops work

As mentioned in the [Introduction]((../Introduction/rationale/whatisthiswork), this workbook is made up of a series of workshops. Each workshop focuses on a particular human social system and attempts to analyse it using one or more tools which are designed for thinking about systems.

After each workshop, I will write a brief review of how the workshop went, and discuss the use of the tools. Occasionally, I will delay the review until finishing a small group of related workshops.

A more complete description of each tool will eventually be found in the tools reference section of this workbook.

The tools will be introduced in the first workshop that uses it, and there will be a link to the reference. The description in the reference section will become more complete as the workshops continue and may even change if a workshop review shows that there is a problem with the tool. If this happens, I will go back to the workshop and update it to match. So if you revisit this site you may find that existing sections have been updated since you last read them. I will discuss the more important updates in the blog that is part of this site.
