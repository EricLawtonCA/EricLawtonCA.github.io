# Global Human Systems - overview

Our planet is dominated by two main human social systems: a division of most of the land area and its bordering seas into sovereign states and by a global economy which is mostly capitalist.

If Elon Musk and his ilk get their way, the economy will expand to include the Solar System under the control of corporations with no inconvenient governments to regulate it. This has already happened, with the launch of thousands of satellites by both Musk and Jeff Bezos to provide competing Internet services, without permission to use the limited low-Earth-orbital space or payment of rent or other fees for its use.
The diagram below illustrates a view of the concepts associated with this. On the left is the Earth, shown as being divided into countries and having a global economy. Each country has its own national economy, consisting of those parts of the global economy which operate within the national boundaries. The global economy is the extension of those beyond and across those boundaries.

Each country has both an overall governance mechanism, which includes both national and sub-national governments as well as the decision-making which affects multiple people, made by powerful people and institutions. Each government and other decision-maker has its own governance mechanism.

There are several dimensions to the governance mechanism. The one illustrated in the diagram is that of the source of power. There is a good [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_forms_of_government#Forms_of_government_by_power_source) on this topic, for details of this and some of the other dimensions. My diagram says “Governance mechanism power may be sourced as Oligarchy, Democracy or Autocracy, which may be a monarchy”. In fact the power may be partly sourced as a mix of all of these; in eurocentric democracies, not all decisions, or even all government decisions, are made by the people or even by the legislature.
Similarly, the economy may be a mix of communist, capitalist, socialist, cooperative or other, with mixed ownership of the means of production. Since a considerable amount of economic activity can happen within one of Earth’s gigantic corporations, the internal economy and governance of these is also important to each of us.
Note that both the governance systems and the forms of economy can be mixed and that  they are mostly independent of each other, though less so for some forms such as communism or anarchism[^fn1].
