# Tools References
## Introduction to this section

In the workshops, I focus on understanding the systems that are the topic of each workshop and only describe as much of each tool as I need for the purposes of the workshop, so that the complete description of the tool is scattered among several workshops.

In this section, I switch the focus to the tools, with a more complete explanation of each one and their relationships to each other. That makes this section more like a library of user manuals for them.

I am publishing them as early drafts, starting by copying the description from the workshop where it is first used and then refining them after each workshop in which I use it.

Each workshop will have a link to this section for each of the tools used, and each tool in this section will have a link back to the workshops which use them, to help clarify the ways in which it can be used. This will be in the form of a list at the end of each tool description.
