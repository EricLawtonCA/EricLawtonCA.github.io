<h1><a id="doc2"></a>What to Expect</h1>
<p>If you want to change the world, you need to have some idea of what a better world looks like. A vision of a future world. That vision should be based on principles, so that is my starting point. Once that is in place, it is useful to identify issues; things that are roadblocks to reaching that future. Only then can you start to build an action plan. Since I am only one of eight billion or so people and I believe in some form of equality, my vision and my principles count for little. So I don’t expect that my current thoughts on these will stand the test of time but I have to start somewhere, based on what I have already learned by listening to others.</p>
<p>So this work will start by outlining my current thoughts and attempting a personal critique and hoping that others will add their thoughts. By the time I have looked at the next level down, of goals and objectives, I will almost certainly have changed my mind on some of them. That is the reason this is a workbook, not a textbook. On the other hand, some principles are too central to allow huge changes. If, for example, your idea of a better world is one which is governed by the rich and powerful for their personal benefit, I am not interested in further discussion.</p>
<p>In this way, principles can help to identify communities, because there are many people in the world who, openly or secretly, do not agree with any version of the principles I feel are important; those towards the right wing of the political spectrum are unlikely ever to agree and are actively working towards a very different vision of the world. Some are not capable of revising those opinions; this work is not for them. We can only succeed by limiting their impact. Others may be persuaded if enough of their peers guide them.</p>
<p>The following are some of the principles I currently feel are the most important . More principles and more details will be provided later in the section on Finding Solutions.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Every human being is equal in rights and dignity. </strong>This does not imply that everyone must be treated equally; that would be unreasonable. It does mean that treatment must be varied in ways which are appropriate to the difference in abilities, needs and circumstances, removing obstacles which can be removed and supporting the needs and goals of everyone as much as you would for a friend or child.</li>
  <li><strong>We need as close as possible to a true democracy.</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> This really follows from the first principle. A true democracy is a system in which everyone has an equal voice and equal power to affect decisions on the public policies that impact their lives. “Public” policy is not just that which is currently set by government but also most of that which is currently set by corporations and by individuals by means of their immense wealth.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Nobody should have a lot more wealth and power by virtue of accident of birth or life events.</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> Every child should have equal access to food, shelter, education and resources equivalent to other children. This includes designing our infrastructure and social systems to provide equal access, regardless of difference of ability, except to the extent that access necessarily requires very specific abilities.</span></li>
  <li><strong>The resources of the planet belong to everyone. </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">The Indigenous people where resources are found have priority and oversight, especially when it comes to damage done to physical, biological and social environments and control of the right to intrude on their lands. “Everyone” includes those still to come - we have no right to consume resources or damage the environment in such a way that that generations still to come will not have the same opportunities as we do. This means being honest and not assuming that, for example, we can use all the available helium because someone will invent a way to make more by nuclear reactions or find a replacement for it.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Everybody has an equal right to basic food and shelter and to the same standard of health care. </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">Human rights are somewhat flexible and not absolute because it is common for one person’s rights to impinge on the rights of another. These three at least seem to be beyond discussion. I will discuss broader rights in more detail later.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Peoples have a right to form self-governing nations. </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">This applies particicularly to Indigenous peoples who already form nations on their own land but includes those historically included within a nation-state who do not wish to be included, either completely as a separate nation or as a sub-national unit.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Simple declarations of rights can become slogans to hide behind while demolishing rights. For example, the false demands for “free speech” by hateful people who pretend that this guarantees them a right to a public platform to spread hateful ideas. However, a democratic body should define the rights and a method of protection. The current United Nations Declarations on Human Rights and on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples are good starting points.</p>
<p>These principles are moral principles, the foundation of how we should treat and work with other people. At times it is useful to have a subordinate set of design principles, derived from the more basic ones but guiding designs and plans for implementing the vision. </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Change must be led by oppressed minorities</strong><span style="font-weight:400;">. This is both an ethical and a practical imperative. We must pay attention to and amplify Indigenous peoples, LGBTQ+, the disabled, those in poverty and more. The issues we face are not abstract to them, they have concrete and detailed knowledge of how the issues manifest and they already have tested ways of working to resolve them. Those of us who are not a member of one of these groups need to listen to them and boost their voices, not talk over them. That is likely to lead to considerable changes to whatever I write here, yet another reason to treat this as a work in progress.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Principled Systems Design. </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">We must design our systems based on our principles, </span><em><span style="font-weight:400; font-style:italic;">as interlocking systems</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">. The idea that we can design them individually, with the majority of them based only on the principle of maximizing profit for a few, is ludicrous. If we do not design them to satisfy our moral principles but instead rely on a mythical “invisible hand” of free markets, we will not know where we want to go or whether we are making any progress. Even the free markets apologists insist that their system will maximize benefits but unless we have broad agreement on what “benefits” are, we will never be able to check.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Measurement and revision</strong><span style="font-weight:400;">: Any systems designs that we propose now may prove to be limited by our current ignorance of what may be possible. Our view from the bottom of the well may miss a lot of the possibilities. And perhaps some of the goals we have today may have consequences that make them less desirable than they seem.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Although some issues such as poverty, bigotry and environmental catastrophe seem to be even more obvious than principles, others appear only as obstacles on the road to implementing a vision.</p>
<div class="summary-box">
A summary of the stuff I've been talking about. A bunch more text to see if the height stays right. Blah blah.
Blah blah.Blah blah.Blah blah.Blah blah.Blah blah.Blah blah.Blah blah.Blah blah.
</div>
<p>First I will introduce the main issues I want to address in the workbook, then I will introduce the tools at a high level. I will then begin to use the tools to address the issues, going through a few iterations of refining tools to better address issues and understanding the issues more as I bring in more tools. Somewhat like roughly hewing out a sculpture with big chisels and then using finer tools to produce the details.  If you follow this on the Internet as I update it, you will see this in process. But eventually I will begin to update the workbook in place so that it will be up to readers to follow links between the separate sections with details of the tools.</p>
<p>The main issues that I start off to address are that</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>We are in crisis. </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">We have already caused irreparable harm to the climate and every year that goes by causes further irreparable damage. We don’t have many years left before the impact of the changes threatens human civilization. Yet we have put people in power in major economies who deny that there is a threat at all and are opposing all efforts to combat the climate emergency and indeed are putting in measures to cause further damage. We are seeing mass extinctions. These are also irreparable and will have ripple effects that will accelerate the rate of extinction, as will climate change. On the human side, we have a very few people with enormous wealth, while millions go hungry or are displaced by war and environmental disasters. The economy is not fit for purpose. We are seeing the return of fascism and dictatorships on an increasing scale, with millions of people at risk of their freedom or lives, living in refugee camps, concentration camps or in conditions of slavery or near slavery. Some of this is because </span><span style="font-family:'Microsoft YaHei'; font-size: 83%; font-weight:400;">…</span></li>
  <li><strong>Yes, They Are Out To Get Us.</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> There are many people who are opposed to the measures we need to take, because they want us to work for their short term benefit under the existing systems. Divide and conquer is their main weapon, augmented by a large array of tools of deception, backed by force. They are extremely dangerous because they care so little about anybody else, even their own children, whose futures they are willing to sacrifice by destruction of the environment to the point where any wealth they can leave them will not protect them from the destruction of the environment we depend on.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Our system is built on lies. </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">It is not even a consistent set of lies, and has little support from evidence, so it is not difficult to disprove them, but we believe them for psychological reasons, not logical ones, so they are hard to dislodge. We need to decolonize our minds. They include the slogans of advertising and the deceit of many politicians as well as “received wisdom” such as the assertion that we live in a democracy because we get a single vote every few years.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Life is complicated</strong><span style="font-weight:400;">. Most things are far more complex than they appear at first glance. This is one of the reasons that the autocrats are able to propagate their lies. We accept vastly oversimplified answers from people in power that persuade us because we don’t understand the bigger picture. This is partly because</span><span style="font-family:'Microsoft YaHei'; font-size: 83%; font-weight:400;">…</span></li>
  <li><strong>Humans are limited and often wrong. </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">We do not have the time, the information or the brain power to make the best decisions, or to re-evaluate all our beliefs whenever we get new information. Psychologists have shown that we are unaware of many of the ways in which we make errors in our thinking. Fortunately, we can make some progress by becoming more aware of our limitations, but we far exceed our limitations because</span><span style="font-family:'Microsoft YaHei'; font-size: 83%; font-weight:400;">…</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span></li>
  <li><strong>Systems Are far more powerful than people</strong><span style="font-weight:400;">. We can compensate for our personal limitations to some extent by learning to work around them, but to a vast extent by working together in an organized fashion. No single human could have built a space station, but an international system of organizations, was able to coordinate the work of rocket scientists, engineers, doctors, miners, mechanics, cafeteria staff, mathematicians and many more to put one into orbit for decades. If we have the right systems, we can resolve our crises, but we consciously design them.</span></li>
</ol>
<p font-weight:600;"><br /></p>
<p>I have no long term solutions because, as the themes imply, things are too complicated for me to do that myself and, as an old white man, I am not the right kind of person to lead the charge for change.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>These main themes are supported by sets of thinking tools that can be used to understand them, and our situation, better. We need to find better ways for individuals to think about complex issues but it is far more important to redesign institutions and systems to improve collective thinking and action. The current institutions of corporations, Nation-States and “democracy” are not designed for this. Instead they are designed to amplify the power of a few, for their personal benefit.</p>
