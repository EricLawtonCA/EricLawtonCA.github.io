# Introduction to tools

## Introduction to Social Systems Thinking

The core of what I have to say is the inversion of Margaret Thatcher’s famous dictum “there is no such thing as society, there are only individuals and families”.
On the contrary, there is no such thing as an isolated individual or family, they are all products of societies.

We are given our humanity through the social institutions we inhabit and make. We learn language easily, not only from our parents but from all that surround us. We use tools made by others, we grow our world-views from the starting point of those of others, though many of us later learn — from others — how to question and adapt those world views.

We use tools made by others, which are possible only through social institutions. Although today many come from the global community through lengthy supply chains, this has always been so. Even the solitary individuals of literature, such as Robinson Crusoe, arrive in that state as adults, furnished with language and ideas for tools which they brought with them from their parent societies.

Very little about our individuality came fully-formed except through our membership in various social systems: family, country, school, economic system, media audience and many more.

Nothing about our behaviour can be understood except in the context of those memberships and our behaviour can have much effect except by way of the support of those systems.

That is why it is as important to understand our roles and their history in those systems as it is to understand our behaviour as individuals and its history.

When should we think in terms of systems? “Almost always” is my basic rule of thumb, mostly just as a corrective to the fact that it is so rarely practised, but that  is perhaps a little too broad.

One indicator that I find useful is to consider how common certain behaviour or thinking is within a given system. If some bad behaviour is exhibited by a small number of people, it may well be due to individual behaviour of those people, acquired before becoming part of the system, especially if that low background proportion is common in other systems. This is the police version of the “few bad apples” theme. They attribute bad behaviour to just a few people behaving badly against a background of mostly wonderful people.


There are quite a few books and academic papers about systems thinking in general. I find that they have a lot of useful ideas, although all that I have read or skimmed show a bias towards the type of system that the author started with. It therefore seems likely that I share that bias so I make a conscious attempt to avoid it. I started my understanding of systems with that of computer systems as I generalised my experience from computer programmer, through application architect to solution architect, which was my final role before retirement.

As programmer, I had to understand the computer systems which were going to run my code. As application architect, I had to understand networks of computer systems which would run the multiple, interacting parts of applications of which I led the design. As solution architect, I had to understand not only the computer and other technology systems but also the human social systems into which they were to be deployed, because their introduction would necessarily trigger changes in the social systems. The larger the projects for which I was technical lead, the more important the social systems became. I think that one reason I got those roles was that I had a broader background in social work and philosophy. Not that the people hiring me used that directly, but because I could demonstrate a deeper understanding of what they were actually looking for.

At this point, it is too early to develop an accurate definition of what I mean by “a system”. For now, I will stick to the Oxford English Dictionary: A group or set of related or associated material or abstract things forming a unity or complex whole, but will elaborate in later sections.

According to this definition, a clock is a system, but most systems theorists spend most of the time, as I will, discussing adaptive systems: those systems that change to adapt to changes in their environment. In this work, I focus even more; I discuss human social systems, such as countries, governments, education systems, communities or welfare systems.

The following diagram[^fn1] shows some of the features which we need to understand in order to understand systems. It is called a System Context concept diagram. The “System Context” part is because I will often draw a similar diagram illustrating a particular system which I will call a system context diagram. Here, we have a rectangle labelled “System”, where in a particular system context diagram would be the name of the particular system in question. So I add the words “concept map” because it is more abstract and shows the names of the concepts which lie behind the parts of an actual system context.

Figure 1: Generic Key External Relationships of Social Systems

The diagram shows that for many social systems — here a rectangle in the middle of the diagram — there are some associated concepts worth investigating.

Systems may have a boundary, which defines the system because we can see what is inside and outside of the boundary. For example, humans have a skin which forms a boundary between them and the outside world, keeping infections out and our fluid contents in. Because social systems are often abstract, they often do not have a boundary, although their are exceptions such as countries and their borders.

Adaptive systems have a history. We often gain insight into what the system does today by looking into that history. In particular, the various stakeholders’ interests are often in conflict, and understanding the history of how they protected  those interests helps to explain the current balance and, since they may have used deceit in protecting those interests, may expose interests that are not what they claim them to be.

Systems interact with their environment and vice versa (which is why the line linking system and environment has an arrow on both ends). Those environments can include the physical environment, such as when a corporation extracts minerals and dumps waste, or can include larger systems of which they are a part, such as when a corporation is part of a capitalist economy. Understanding these interactions are essential to understanding their behaviour and importance.

There are stakeholders who have interests in the system. I hesitated several times over this word, because when used in business contexts, it often has the meaning of “those who have acquired a stake in the company” - derived from the use in gambling where your stake is the amount you have bet. However, it also means anyone with an interest in the impacts of the system, such as the global public who have an interest in having clean air and a stable climate, which is affected by the emissions of corporations. That is the meaning I adopt here. We usually identify stakeholders by their role, rather than as particular individuals.

In social systems, we also have to recognise that the stakeholders may be a part of the system, which is one of the main reason that social systems thinking needs special care to ensure that the tools for generic systems thinking are applicable without change. This is represented on the diagram by the relationship “Stakeholder may be part of system”. It is also important to investigate to what extent the stakeholders are conscious of both the workings of the system and their roles within the system because that influences how likely they are to act as agents of change within the system. This is a particular distinguishing feature of social systems when compared with other complex adaptive systems.

Note the concept “Interest” which defines each of the distinct interests for each stakeholder with respect to each system. For example, the public may have interests in a justice system that they are protected from criminal or civil harm, that they have fair hearings if they are accused within the system, that judgements are appropriate for harms caused and that the amount paid to maintain the system is in balance with the benefits of the system when compared with those of other uses of public money. On the other hand, some of the participants in that system, such as police, may have interests in growing their budget and power.

One particular type of concern of particular note is “purpose”. Contrary to some systems thinking books, systems do not usually have a single purpose. Purposes are conferred by people or by social institutions onto tools, including the systems they make. One person’s purpose for an iron may be to remove wrinkles from clothes; another person may use it to keep the door open.

For most voters, the purpose of a democracy may be to give them an equal say in decision-making, but for the wealthy, it may be to provide an illusion of that so that they can retain power in proportion to their wealth. This conflict, together with the history of eurocentric democracy which resulted from the struggle of the “lower orders” to wrest power first from the aristocracy and then from business owners, help us understand better why we have such an imperfect compromise which still mostly favours the rich. I will explore this in more detail later.

A further addition to the diagram that is unique to social systems is that stakeholders may create or promote false images of the social system which are used as marketing tools to gain consent to the the current functioning of the system. For example, the pretence that free-markets are the most efficient way of producing goods and services or that representative democracy gives every voter an equal say in decision-making. These are often false histories. We are seeing these remade now in the USA where State lawmakers are legislating against what they call “Critical Race Theory” but are specifically aimed at reshaping history by suppressing facts about racism. We also see it in the received history in the UK where Empire has always been taught as a Good Thing, bringing civilisation to the world, with no mention of the horrors of colonialism, enslavement and resource extraction among others things.
