# Sovereign States are a bad ideas

## Countries as Systems

Countries are systems.  In some cases they were created fairly recently and extremely artificially by former colonisers, with boundaries having no relationship to the nations or tribes on whose territory they are formed.

Here is a first attempt to create a Key External Relationships Diagram for a country, by taking the key external relationships for a generic social system from the introduction to [Social Systems Thinking](socialsystemsthinking), and making it more specific.

Figure 1: System Context Diagram for a generic country.

Because it’s for a generic country, there is not a lot of detail to be added from the generic diagram, but it illustrates a step in the process of moving to a more specific model.

The changes are to relabel “Stakeholder” to external stakeholder, because the most important stakeholders are actually internal, such as the residents. Internal stakeholdes will be shown on the next diagram which shows the internal components of a country.

The external stakeholders include other countries, whose interests may be formal, through treaties, alliances diplomatic or formal colonial relationships, or informal through practises such as resource dependencies and informal colonial relationships.

They also include international institutions like the United Nations or global institutions which include global corporations. Note the distinction between “international”, which are nation-to-nation and “global” which relate to their components without using national governments as intermediaries. One drawback of the United Nations is that its governance is through country’s governments, so that repressed minorities in a country have no direct representation. Even nations such as Indigenous nations, which do have some representation do so only at the discretion of their colonisers.

The history of a country is clearly important. We cannot understand the reality of its components and behaviour without understanding that. Even when there are major disruptions to those histories, such as revolutions or wars, the culture of the population carries some inertia which affects the possibilities for change. The history represented in the context diagram is the real history, to the extent to which it is known or can even be defined. Since the boundaries change and are created and dissolved, along with other attributes by which we recognize “the same country” it may not always be whether the same country still exists. Notwithstanding Vera Lynn’s wartime song “There’ll always be an England”, there certainly wasn’t one when the island was occupied by the Romans. Although it was formally united by Æthelstan in 927, it must have taken months if not a few years to make that a practical reality given the speed of communication in those days and the need to establish a full administration. I have my doubts that it will survive another thousand years.

Countries also create mythical histories as a means of propaganda, to encourage loyalty to the state, but that is better represented on the component model, seen below, because it is an internal component, manufactured by the state through institutions like schools, media, museums and citizenship tests, and also enthusiastically reinforced by private institutions and people.

The physical environment is the land, sea and air within the physical boundaries. It may provide resources such as minerals, capacity for agriculture, parks, wild harvests such as fish, and it implies stewardship ― the responsibility to take care of the environment for its own sake, for the use of future generations, and because of the impact outside the boundaries, such as the health of rivers downstream and the quality of the air, neither of which are constrained by country boundaries.

The physical boundary is enforced by physical controls such border guards and military, but also by many virtual controls such as taxation on the flow of capital, constraints on foreign ownership of vital industries and land. Some of this is managed by the government, but some flows are managed by global and international institutions. They are also managed by other countries because in many cases the border is shared with one or more other countries.

All of these represent significant two-way interactions which will affect the internal components of a country.

The following internal structure diagram summarises the internal parts for a generic country.

Figure 2: Internal Structure Diagram for a Generic Country.

The diagram shows the main components of a country, which are a sovereign government which probably has a military, a territory which may contain resources, residents who may be citizens, and an economy.

I will explore all these in greater detail in subsequent workshops.

Although a country has a sovereign government, that may be only theoretical, either because other countries may violate that sovereignty or because it has voluntarily entered into binding treaties. The first is is one reason that those sovereign governments probably have a military and one of the major reasons they are such a bad idea. The second is a better idea.

The next workshop will explore sovereignty in greater detail.

One of the main powers that the state takes is the ability to manage the economy of the country in the interests of those who control it. This gives a huge incentive to people who thirst after wealth and power to take control of the state. The state defines borders around the national[^fn1] economy. They are usually very porous, to allow the wealthy to move money in and out at will, but in some cases even capitalist nations close many gaps. When the UK had a major balance of payments crisis, it put severe limits on the movement of money in and out of the country, though there were exceptions for the wealthy because it would otherwise have damaged their international banking centre.

The diagram also says that a country may be a partial democracy. This is in a different colour to indicate that this is an attribute of a country, rather than a separate part.  This will be the subject of several later workshops. It also says that a nation may be a country and vice versa, though colonialism has made this increasingly rare. Generally the concept is most useful when a nation is seeking recognition of its sovereignty from colonial rule, since a nation is less of an artificial construct than a country.

[^fn1]: The use of “national” as an adjective blurs the distinction between country and nation but that is the common usage, as in “National anthem”.
