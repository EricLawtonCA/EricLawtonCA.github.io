## The point of it all

### What’s In It For Us?

Collaboration has two main benefits. The first is that two brains are better than one, the second is that for the more complex problems that face us, the thoughts of individual thinkers are of little value. They require more interdisciplinary, system-level thinking and acting than any individual is capable of, even if the individual makes no errors which is impossible. As H.L. Menken said,

>For every complex problem, there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.

Unfortunately, those answers are easy for politicians to sell, so we need to arm ourselves against them.

My view of the world is that we are social beings. That means that it is better both for ourselves and for others that we have to care for each other as individuals and that we design and cultivate the social systems we live in, in a way that allows everyone to thrive.

This is aimed at readers who recognize the injustice in the world and wants to change that.

It will be of no value to people who are strong supporters of populist politicians, who are anti-immigrant, who think Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ2S+  or any other group currently excluded from privileges are inferior or should give up their identity and assimilate or to anyone of similar beliefs.

It won’t help you if you believe that individual rights trump all social needs or that your particular subset of humanity is somehow superior to others, whether that is based on some concept of race, gender, sex, religion, ability, nationality or similar attributes, I don’t intend to spend much time arguing that these beliefs are false; there is plenty of evidence that this is so. However, many of the discussions that follow will support this conclusion.

These exclusions are because experience suggests that people with these beliefs are too committed to their beliefs for it to be likely that they will change their minds, though I will eventually provide some reasons why, even by their own standards, they are wrong to hold these beliefs. Perhaps some will change their attitudes.

Many other people are doing more important work in organizing change, have far deeper knowledge than I do of particular situations and have developed or adapted their own thinking tools. I offer my collection of tools as something I have found useful so far and am developing further through writing this. They are yours to use, adapt or discard. Feel free to let me know if they are useful or not, through my Internet contact points. Even if this workbook is not useful for those doing the work, I hope that this will be of some use in encouraging people at least to avoid being obstacles to necessary change and perhaps even to learn enough to join the efforts to change things.

If you do find any of this useful, I guarantee you will find writings by people who have been marginalised by the power structures and accompanying personal attitudes in the dominant systems in the eurocentric world to be even more useful, including Indigenous, racialised, LGBTQ+, disabled and more. Their perspectives are more valuable than mine. I was not brought up to realise this, so I am still having to listen carefully, with both imagination and diligence to what they have to say, because my world-view tends to be self-perpetuating and reinforced by the systems I live in. Sometimes what I am told doesn’t fit with what I think I know at the time, so I have to take on trust for a while that it makes sense when I am able to change my perspective.

However, so far it has been worth the effort. I often feel uncomfortable to learn that I have been wrong, but it’s far better than continuing to be wrong.
