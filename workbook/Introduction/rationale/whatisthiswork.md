# Workbook Introduction

## The point of it all

### What is this workbook about?

I am interested in understanding the human social systems in which we live and changing them for the better. The best way I know to do that is to work through my thoughts in writing, with plenty of diagrams, while reading news items, history books, academic papers, pundits and  other relevant works with a critical eye.

Over the years, I have acquired a set of tools for this but they also need some work to adapt them from their sources. I am hoping that by writing this workbook in a kind of circular fashion, first outlining a few of the tools and then applying them to analyse particular systems and then refining both my understanding of the systems and improving (or abandoning) the tools where they  don’t work as well as I thought.

It is my own personal workbook, but I am publishing it on the Internet as I go, in case someone finds it of interest.

There are three main components which are required to understand systems:  a set of values that the systems should implement, data that tells us what the systems actually do, and a set of thinking tools for analysing them.

I begin this with a starter set of each of these — we all have some version of these — but I know there are flaws in my current version of all of these, so I am writing this as a set of “workshops” in which I lay out a question, do some work on a problem and show my work, then reflect on the work and see where there may be issues. I expect to change some, or possibly all of them in the end, although I will leave some of them up as illustrations of how and why my thinking has changed, accompanied by a commentary to explain the changes.

I don’t expect to change my core values, but on several occasions in my life I have found that at a more detailed level, some values I held could not be reconciled with more fundamental principles; I have no reason to believe that I have eliminated them all.

My focus is on understanding human social systems, such as “the economy”, or “the education system” as systems, which is to say as integrated wholes which also interact with a larger context. We are not taught much of that in our common education, only when we reach more advanced levels and specialise in particular systems. Since many of us supposedly live in democracies — political systems systems in which we all have an important role to play in decision making — we should all have some basic tools that give us the understanding we need to express our opinions on those systems.

That is what I intend to work on here. I do have a starting set of thinking tools that I have adapted from earlier work by others and have found to be useful over a few decades of use, which I believe are useful — this work will tell.

The systems I will look at include the economy, government, democracy and the media, and eventually many more supporting systems.

This introduction has three parts, as background to the workshops:

1. This overview of the rationale for the workbook. I explain what’s in it for me and might be in it for you. I also explain a little about myself, so that you can see how my perspectives have been shaped and to give some idea where my strengths and weaknesses might be in writing this.
2. An explanation of the structure of the whole work, introducing an overall framework for assessing situations and taking steps to change them.
3. A slightly more detailed overview of each of the four main elements in the framework, to introduce some of the tools that you may not have seen before or use different terms for them, so that we all have a starting point for the workshops.

The workbook as a whole has three main parts:
1. This introduction
2. A series of workshops — working sessions, each on a particular topic — in which I try to understand the world better and try to find ways to improve it. At the end of many of them, I will add a "lessons learned" entry which will explain what I thought worked or didn't work and the changes I am making to make the tools work better.
3. A reference section, in which I will explain the tools in a more complete form, because the workshops will only be illustrating particular uses of them.  These will be rudimentary at first because I will build on them with the lessons learned from each workshop.
