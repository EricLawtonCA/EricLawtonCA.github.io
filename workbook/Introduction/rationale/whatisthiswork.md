# Workbook Introduction

## The point of it all

### What is this work?

This is a book about tools for understanding the human social systems in which we live and changing them for the better. It is my own personal workbook, but I am publishing it on the Internet as I go.

There are three main components which are required to understand systems:  a set of values that the systems should implement, data that tells us what the systems actually do, and a set of thinking tools for analysing them.

I begin this with a starter set of these — we all have some version of these — but I know there are flaws in my current version of all of these, so I am writing this in workbook form — a set of “workshops” in which I lay out a question, do some work on a problem and show my work, then reflect on the work and see where there may be issues. I expect to change some, or possibly all of them in the end, although I will leave some of them up as illustrations of how and why my thinking has changed, accompanied by a commentary to explain the changes.

I don’t expect to change my core values, but on several occasions in my life I have found that at a more detailed level, some values I held could not be reconciled with more fundamental principles; I have no reason to believe that I have eliminated them all.

My focus is on understanding human social systems, such as “the economy”, or “the education system” as systems, which is to say as integrated wholes which also interact with a larger context. We are not taught much of that in our common education, only when we reach more advanced levels and specialise in particular systems. Since many of us supposedly live in democracies — political systems systems in which we all have an important role to play in decision making — we should all have some basic tools that give us the understanding we need to express our opinions on those systems.

That is what I intend to work on here. I do have a starting set of thinking tools that I have adapted from earlier work by others and have found to be useful over a few decades of use, which I believe are useful — this work will tell..

The data I use will come from the books, academic journals, news and social media. Of course, I will not take these for granted but will use some of the tools to analyse them.  

The systems I will look at include the economy, government, democracy and the media.

This introduction has three parts, as background to the workshops:

1. This overview of the introduction and rationale for the workbook. I explain what’s in it for me and might be in it for you. I also explain a little about myself, so that you can see how my perspectives have been shaped and to give some idea where my strengths and weaknesses might be in writing this.
2. An explanation of the structure of the whole work, introducing an overall framework for assessing situations and taking steps to change them.
3. A slightly more detailed overview of each of the four main elements in the framework, to introduce some of the tools for thinking which are often only covered in specialised courses, so that we all have a starting point for the workshops.

The workbook as a whole has three main parts:
1. This introduction
2. A series of workshops — working sessions, each on a particular topic — in which I try to understand the world better and try to find ways to improve it.
3. A summary section, in which I will explain some of the tools and results of my thinking in a more complete form, because some of the workshops will only be looking at things from a particular perspective, revisiting the same topic several times, separated by looking at other things.
