## The point of it all

### What’s In It For You

I hope that you will find some new ways of thinking, or at least find newer ways of applying them. We all have limited minds, limited experience and limited memories, so it’s likely that there will be something new for you.

I don’t know your situation or what you would find useful. You will  figure out soon enough if what I say has value for you, even if it is because you see what is wrong with my reasoning and so clarify your own thinking. I welcome constructive feedback; message me on Twitter, [@eric0lawton](https://twitter.com/Eric0Lawton).

You may find that some of the things you were taught are false, whether formally in school or by the PR industry for corporations, governments and other institutions.
Or perhaps some additional support for your current beliefs.

On the other hand, you probably won’t get anything out of this if you are not already predisposed to believe in equality, human rights, the balance of freedom with responsibility to others, and the need to support beliefs by evidence. It seems unlikely that you will be convinced after reading this if you don’t already lean towards such beliefs and after seventy years of thinking about such things, I haven’t changed my opinion by much.
