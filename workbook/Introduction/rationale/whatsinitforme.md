## The point of it all

### What’s in it for me?

The world is in a mess.  We are in the midst of a deadly pandemic and climate and biodiversity crises, but people are resisting the means to end them; we have an illegitimate political system which claims to be a democracy but excludes most people from most decisions, instead they are made by the rich and powerful in their own interests; we are continuing the genocide of Indigenous peoples, yet we white people are  in denial at best, or actively participating because we benefit from it; fascism is rising again;  we have more information and knowledge widely available than ever before, yet it is often behind pay-walls and overwhelmed by a flood of free misinformation, lies and propaganda, to name but a few of the inter-related set of crises.

This is the result of deliberate choices made by powerful people that are made in order to maintain their wealth and power, rather than to create systems that will provide a better life for most of us.

My main goals are to understand this by analysing the dominant institutions of the eurocentric world as systems as well as collections of individual people, with some thoughts about how we can change it. These goals — especially the second — can only be collaborative projects, so I would be happier if some other people read it, though it is also a form of collaboration to read other people’s work and to get some more general feedback on social media.

This whole exercise is a rather grand ambition, but in Isaac Newton’s words, I am standing on the shoulders of giants, trying to understand things through the thinking tools that they have developed. It is mine only in the sense that their thoughts have been applied to my experiences and selected and interpreted based on that. It is perhaps only self-therapy, in which I try to hear the words of others as advice and counsel, and thereby bring myself some hope that things can get better. It is primarily for my own benefit, on the principle of “how do I know what I think until I see what I write?” [^fn1]  The act of writing forces me to be clearer and face my mistakes.

Many of the giants I wish to learn from are from oppressed minorities. They know far better than I do what the problems are, they have large bodies of learning on the struggles to change them and on alternative ways of structuring  systems of governance, collaboration, learning and more.
Working through these workshops helps me to find ways to understand what they want to share, by opening my mind to other ways of thinking. I find that by writing things down, re-reading critically and reworking, I expose a lot of errors in my thinking. This removes false assumptions that I have somehow acquired and improves my understanding of the tools I use for the analysis. Sometimes ways of thinking that work well on a small scale do not work so well on a larger scale.

Regardless of where all these attitudes and beliefs came from, as I approach my third quarter century, it’s time for a major pruning before I lose the capacity.

At this point in my life, I can no longer be as physically active in taking to the streets and I no longer have influence by being part of any organisations in which I have a say. I am isolated from physical communities because I live outside urban communities and recently even more so by the Covid-19 pandemic; I would like to move from my current rural location to a more urban one, but circumstances don’t permit it immediately.
