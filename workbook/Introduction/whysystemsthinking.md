## There's no such thing as individuals

Margaret Thatcher famously said 
> there's no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families[^fn1].

This book is based on almost the opposite premise: that there is no such thing as individual human beings, only an inseparable relationship between humans and the society that makes them.

We do not spring, fully-formed, from the Earth. We are born as helpless babies and only become functioning humans by our interactions with other members of our society in their various roles in the institutions that make up that society; our families, schools, corporations, governments and more.

What makes a suburban Canadian office worker similar to their co-workers, but different from a Russian factory worker or a !Kung woman in the Kalahari? It is not their DNA, or choices made by a set of individuals that just coincidentally happen to be similar to their neighbour‚Äôs choices but very different from the others. The similarities and differences come from the social structures in which they each grew up.

This complex inter-relationship, between people and their social environment is crucial to understanding both, to the extent that we can, and it is even more crucial to designing the replacement systems, to the limited extent that conscious design and implementation of those systems is possible.

We cannot hope to understand either individual humans or social structures without understanding how each develops, in the context of other individuals and institutions. To do that, we need a set of tools designed to help us do that, which is the subject of this book. I call the toolkit ‚Äúsocial systems thinking‚Äù, which is fairly close to the usage of others. I don‚Äôt call it ‚Äúsystems theory‚Äù, because I think it is as yet too early to claim that there is a sufficiently broad and useful theory to cover it. On the other hand, the term ‚Äúsystems thinking‚Äù has been claimed by writers in a business context such as Peter Senge. This is not that, but there are some common threads, I have only read summaries of those works. They seem to focus on how to make businesses more profitable; I am more interested in change on a wider scale, with a more complex set of results. Not an easy to measure result like more profit but a more just, equitable, healthy society, which makes the problem far more challenging.

My own, current toolkit is drawn from several sources:
* My years of practice as an IT architect, which in spite of the ‚ÄúInformation Technology‚Äù part of the role, is primarily about human systems. The technology part is the adaptation of computers to serve those systems and the changes that occur within the human systems as a consequence of introducing or changing the computer systems within them, in a parallel process to the interaction of humans and their systems.
* My formal education and self-study in philosophy
* Wide reading and discussion in sociology, psychology, history and economics
* A few years practicing politics as a campaign manager and consitituency chair as well as a lot of reading
* Reading other works on social systems

One of the lessons I have learned while writing this is that this is not enough. The disciplines I have mentioned are each too wide for one person to master and there are other disciplines that are relevant, such as neurobiology, anthropology, linguistics and psychology. I think that the solution is to use systems to do the thinking. Just as it takes a complex system to put a few astronauts on the moon, it will take some very complex, purpose-made systems to understand and change our current society for the better. I don‚Äôt yet have any idea how we can do that but clearly the problem is urgent, given the way we are going, with pandemics, a climate crisis and, in Anglo-centric countries, a democracy crisis.

As Slavoj ≈Ωa≈æek asks ‚ÄúDear Leftists, What Happens the Day After the Revolution?‚Äù[ In his YouTube video ‚ÄúWhy There Are No Viable Political Alternatives to Unbridled Capitalism‚Äù]. If we aren‚Äôt able to think things through, we are at risk of The Terror that followed the French Revolution or a dictatorship like that of Stalin after the Russian Revolution. Perhaps we can manage a less violent revolution than either of those, although it seems the ultra-wealthy are not aware of what happens when a few people unconscionably wealthy while too many are going hungry or unhoused.

Learning the tools of social systems thinking is not easy, and it has to be done in the face of constant bombardment with advertising and propaganda that sells the opposite notion, that much simpler thinking can give the answers we need, summarized in a few simple slogans.

One important aspect of systems thinking is that it tends to be circular, in two senses. One is that it requires learning and creating a new set of concepts which allow for a better understanding, which exposes some problems which in turn are best resolved by changing our understanding of the new concepts or even inventing new ones.

This is similar to the way in which physics took the concept of energy, refined its understanding based on Newton‚Äôs theories of motion, force and inertia, then further refined it to account for the ability to see mass and energy as interchangeable through Einstein‚Äôs famous equation e=mc¬≤ and then in quantum mechanics as an operator aciting on the wave function of a system. 

There‚Äôs no need here to understand the physics. I‚Äôm just pointing out that our usual way of teaching physics is to teach children in secondary school the simpler Newtonian concepts, relatively easy to grasp, and only then to layer on the more sophisticated modern concepts I just mentioned in university-level studies.

Humans are capable of  going straight from our everyday use of energy, as in ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, I don‚Äôt seem to have any energy today‚Äù, to understanding the sophisticated use in quantum mechanics without a long process of building familiarity through several cycles of increasingly complex theories.

I‚Äôm not about to try to learn, or teach, the equivalent in social systems thinking of quantum mechanics. There are some mathematical tools in this area, such as Bayesian Networks, which can be used on a computer to help analyse systems but I‚Äôm not going to do more than mention them briefly in a later section.

However, I am going to go round the circle of refining the concepts twice. I‚Äôll leave it as an exercise to the reader to go round the third time (just kidding üòÄ). 

The second circle is that of analyzing a system, designing changes or a replacement and then implementing it, while using the tools. I‚Äôll describe this in more detail shortly, because I use it for the overall structure of this workbook. I call it the MADPE loop and it is shown in the graphic in the header of my web site.

In practice, both circles go on at the same time; as we do the work of understanding and changing systems, we update our conceptual frameworks.

That is why I am writing this as a workbook, in the sense that I start by working through the analysis of some systems, using basic versions of the tools, and then elaborating by updating the tools, then analyzing the systems again with the updated tools.

The workshops form one of two main sections of the workbook. The other is the current final state of each of the tools used, called ‚ÄúTools Reference‚Äù. I write that before the first use of each tool, which I then describe in the workshop that uses it first. Then, after each workshop, I look at how effective the tools have been and update the description of each tool, modifying it to incorporate any lessons learned.

I won‚Äôt go through the full outer cycle which involves using our understanding of the systems to change them, then repeating the process, though I describe it briefly in the section ‚ÄúOverall structure - MADPE loop‚Äù, before starting the main workshops.

The workbook as a whole has three main parts:
1. This introduction
2. A series of workshops ‚Äî working sessions, each on a particular topic ‚Äî in which I try to understand the world better and try to find ways to improve it. At the end of many of them, I will add a "lessons learned" entry which will explain what I thought worked or didn't work and the changes I am making to make the tools work better.
3. A reference section, in which I will explain each of the tools in a more complete form, because the workshops will only be illustrating particular uses of them. These will be rudimentary at first because I will start with a sketch and then modify and detail them with the lessons learned from each workshop. 

This introduction has three parts, as background to the workshops:
1. The part you are reading now.
2. A description of the MADPE loop: an overall structure for assessing systems and changing them. I introduce this here because it gives an overall context of where the tools can be used and I will provide more details in some of the workshops.
3. An overview of some systems thinking tools, as preparation for the first workshops.

These main parts are followed by a glossary of terms which I have used in a specific manner in the workbook or which are not in common use.  They are also accompanied by an ‚Äúabout me‚Äù section and a blog.

The ‚Äúabout me‚Äù may give some understanding of my personal context and shed some light on how I came to these opinions.

The blog contains some thoughts which occur to me while writing this, including reflections on current events in the light of the main contents, which would make the main work too long and soon outdated.
