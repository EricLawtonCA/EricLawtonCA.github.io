### Global Human Systems

Our planet is dominated by two main human social systems: a division of most of the land area and its bordering seas into sovereign states and by a global economy which is mostly capitalist.

If Elon Musk and his ilk get their way, the economy will expand to include the Solar System under the control of corporations with no inconvenient governments to regulate it. This has already happened, with the launch of thousands of satellites by both Musk and Jeff Bezos to provide competing Internet services, without permission to use the limited low-Earth-orbital space or payment of rent or other fees for its use.

The diagram below is a simple view of the major, global, human systems. On the right is the Earth, shown as being divided into countries and having a global economy. Each country has its own national economy, consisting of those parts of the global economy which operate within the national boundaries. The global economy is the extension of those beyond and across those boundaries.

Each country has a government, in which power may be structured as an democracy, an oligarchy or an autocracy, or a mix of all three. Autocracies may be monarchies, in which the power is inherited.

In eurocentric democracies, not all decisions, or even all government decisions, are made by the people or even by the legislature.

There is a good Wikipedia article on this topic, for details of this and some of the other dimensions.
Similarly, the economy may be a mix of communist, capitalist, socialist, cooperative or other, with mixed ownership of the means of production. Since a considerable amount of economic activity can happen within one of Earth’s gigantic corporations, the internal economy of each of these is also important to each of us, and so is the way in which it participates in the economies of each country and of the

Note that both the governance systems and the forms of economy can be mixed and that  they are mostly independent of each other, though less so for some forms such as communism or anarchism[ At least, that’s what I see at this early point in the workbook.].

It is important to note that there is no global government. There are some global governance structures but they are severely limited by the power of the  sovereign states, which I will call countries for reasons which I will explain in the first workshop.
