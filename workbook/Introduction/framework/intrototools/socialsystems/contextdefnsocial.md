## Social Systems thinking

### Defining Social systems

The sources of my knowledge of systems thinking up to now are a mix of semi-popular books, scientific papers, design standards for systems where humans and computers interact, and personal experience.

There are quite a few books and many academic papers about systems thinking in general. I find that they have a lot of useful ideas, although all that I have read or skimmed show a bias towards the type of system that the author started with. It therefore seems likely that I share that bias so I make a conscious attempt to avoid it. I started my understanding of systems with that of computer systems as I generalised my experience from computer programmer, through application architect to solution architect, which was my final role before retirement.

As programmer, I had to understand the computer systems which were going to run my code. As application architect, I had to understand networks of computer systems which would run the multiple, interacting parts of applications of which I led the design. As solution architect, I had to understand not only the computer and other technology systems but also the human social systems into which they were to be deployed, because their introduction would necessarily trigger changes in the social systems. The larger the projects for which I was technical lead, the more important the social systems became. I think that one reason I got those roles was that I had a broader background in social work and philosophy. Not that the people hiring me used that directly, but because I could demonstrate a deeper understanding of what they were actually looking for.

I find it useful to start work on a topic with dictionary definitions. As mentioned before, they are not to be treated as authorities but as distillations of usage; a starting point, not an end point, for further study.
I will begin with the Oxford English Dictionary:
>A group or set of related or associated material or abstract things forming a unity or complex whole,

but will elaborate in later sections.

According to this definition, a clock is a system, but most systems theorists spend most of the time, as I will, discussing complex, adaptive systems: those systems that are difficult to predict and are able to change themselves to adapt to changes in their environment. In this work, I focus even more; I discuss human social systems, such as countries, governments, education systems, communities or welfare systems.

Although human social systems share some features in common with other complex adaptive systems, I will have to take care in these workshops when using tools based on other types of system because of the specific types of complexity of human roles and behaviour and the wider range of behaviour of those humans with regard to the system.

Another challenge is in defining the boundaries of human social systems. Sometimes it is obvious, such as with the boundaries of a country sometimes not at all, such as democracy— a free press is essential, but is it part of democracy as a system or just a part of the environment which is required to support one? Even the boundary of a country needs thought. Are airports part of the boundary? Embassies abroad? Internet gateways (through which money, goods and services flow)?

I will attempt to answer these questions in the workshops. I have some outlines of answers in my head, but those things don’t always survive the attempt to document them in detail.
