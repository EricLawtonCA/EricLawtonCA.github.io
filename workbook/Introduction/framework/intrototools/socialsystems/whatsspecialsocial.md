### What’s Special About Social Systems Thinking

The main reasons social systems often need to be treated differently from other complex, adaptive systems is the fact that usually components of other systems are not, at the same time, components of other systems, and they are shaped only by their interactions with the rest of their single system. People, on the other hand, may be part of multiple systems or even play multiple roles within a single system. For example, they may be both a worker and a consumer within a national economy.
People are also strongly shaped by the systems they live within, much as cells with the same DNA can be shaped into brain cells or kidney cells depending on which organ they  find themselves in.

That brings me to the starting point of this workbook: the inversion of Margaret Thatcher’s famous dictum “there is no such thing as society, there are only individuals and families”.

On the contrary; there is no such thing as an isolated individual or family, we are all products of society, which is a complex mix of social systems: communities, countries, economies, schools and many more.

We are given our humanity through the social institutions we inhabit and make. We learn language easily, not only from our parents but from all that surround us. We use tools made by others, we grow our world-views from the starting point of those of others, though many of us later learn — from others — how to question and adapt those world views.

We use tools made by others, which are possible only through social institutions. This has always been so, although today many come from the global community through lengthy supply chains. Even the solitary individuals of literature, such as Robinson Crusoe, arrive in that state as adults, furnished with language and ideas for tools which they brought with them from their parent societies. The few feral children documented by journalists[ E.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child] behave in far from socially human ways.

Nothing about our individuality came fully-formed except through our membership in various social systems: family, country, school, economic system, media audience and many more.

Very little about our behaviour can be understood except in the context of those memberships and our behaviour can have much effect except by way of the support of those systems.

That is why it is as important to understand our roles and their history in those systems as it is to understand our behaviour as individuals and with our own history.

When should we think in terms of systems? “Almost always” is my basic rule of thumb, mostly just as a corrective to the fact that it is so rarely practised.

When it comes to how much a system has shaped the humans within it, an indicator that I find useful is to consider how common certain behaviour or thinking is within a given system. If some bad behaviour is exhibited by a small number of people, it may well be due to individual behaviour of those people, acquired before becoming part of the system, especially if that low background proportion is common in other systems. This is the police version of the “few bad apples” theme. They attribute bad behaviour to just a few people behaving badly against a background of mostly wonderful people.

On the other hand, if there are a higher proportion of people exhibiting particular characteristics or behaviours than is seen in the general population, it is more likely that the system is producing the behaviour. In the case of the police, for example, the training, peer pressure and measurement systems all tend to promote violence, racism and other bigotries, lack of accountability, arrogance and other reasons why we should abolish the police. It is also often the case that recruitment practices ensure that people entering the system already share some of the behaviours, or at least show that they are likely to be easy to shape into those behaviours.
