# Workbook Introduction
## Framework
### Social Systems Thinking
#### Motivation

If you gently kick a soccer ball, it will roll away at predictable angle and speed, based on simple factors like how hard you kicked, in what direction and how far off-centre from the direction of your kick.
If you kick a small, sleeping animal of about the same size and weight, the result is likely to be very different. It will wake  up immediately and change its shape. It may run away and keep running, but it might decide to fight back. The direction it goes will vary a lot: it might take flight or climb a tree; a balled-up snake might strike at you, bite and kill you; a cat might just run out of range and stop.

Even a simple device like a bear trap might literally spring into action and grab your leg in its steel jaws.

This is because they are all systems of one kind or another: they have internal parts which interact and make them do things which you can’t predict unless you know something of their internal workings. In its simplest terms, this is the point of systems thinking.

Animals and other forms of life are more complex types of system than a bear trap and are far less predictable. That is why we call them complex systems. They have another feature: they change their behaviour depending on their environment, they are adaptive.

There are a lot of books and scientific papers about complex adaptive systems, which point out that there are enough similarities between their different kinds, such as organisms, ecosystems, automated control systems like heating and cooling systems with a thermostat, Earth’s climate and more.

They also investigate human social systems, like the economy, a country, democracy or a school.

This workbook is mostly about those, although like the other authors, I will look at some of the other types of system for analogies to see if the tools which work for them still apply for social systems. Some do not because of the special nature of human social systems. Part of the goal of the workshops in here is to see how well they work, if at all.

Systems thinking is important for several reasons. As the snake example shows above, knowing what to expect if you interact with the system in a particular way can be very important to your survival, health or well-being.

Another reason is that people often try to fool you with simplistic arguments, for example how much better off you will be with lower taxes because you will have more money left in your bank account, when in fact you may have less because that meant a program you depended on would be cut, or there would be other side effects, not mentioned, like uncollected stinking garbage in the streets.

The most important reason is that some of our systems are leading us towards disaster, they are producing deadly climate change, genocide and war, polluted air, land and water, disease and poverty. All these are preventable, but we need to redesign and change our systems to do that. We need to understand why they are producing these effects and to be sure that the results of changing them will be an improvement and will not make things worse.
