### Social Systems: The Inside Story

After looking at the system’s external relationships, the next step is a first look at the internals, attempting to identify its component parts.

Figure 1: Generic Social System Internals

As in the external view, the idea is to use this diagram or text to prompt questions about the system. In this case, as a notational convenience, the parts are all drawn inside the rectangle representing the social system. They could all be outside, with the addition of arrows showing that, for example, the social system has components, has resources stocks and so on. The boundary is drawn on the boundary, again just a convenience, with the relationship “social system may have a boundary”.

In some cases, the components may be systems themselves, in which case we call them subsystems. They may be humans who are participants in the system.

Systems do things. The things it can do are called processes. They usually have some kind of resources which are kept within the system. These are may be generically called stocks. For example a bank may have a stock of cash and its various processes such as taking deposits or making loans may replenish or may deplete these stocks.

If this is not clear yet, it will probably become clearer when we start to use them in real examples.
