## Introduction to tools for Thinking

### Social Systems ― System Context

The first few tools provide for broad-brush understanding of a system; sometimes enough to see that people with vested interests are being less than honest or at least honestly wrong in their assertions about systems. The first is to look at the system context — the external view of the system.
One way to portray this is by using a diagram called the system context diagram[^fn1].

If you are not able to see the diagram, or don’t readily think in diagrams, that’s fine because like all diagrams in the book, it is merely a summary of the description in the surrounding text which some people find helpful. It shows some of the external relations which we need to understand in order to understand systems. The example here is a Generic System Context concept diagram.

It is generic, or abstract, in the sense that it has nothing about a specific system; it will be used as a starting point for similar diagrams for specific systems. It can be read as a set of questions for analysing systems. For example the diagram contains a relationship that says “Interested party has interest in Social System”, which serves as a prompt for a real system to ask “who are the interested parties?” and “what are their interests in the system”. Those interests may include financial, health, power, safety and may be summed up for them as the purpose of the system.

Here, I have a rectangle labelled “Social System”. It stands for whatever social system this diagram is used for. When using this as a template for a particular social system, the label would be changed to the name of the particular system in question. There will be lots of examples in the workshops.

The diagram (and this text) shows that for many social systems there are some associated concepts worth investigating.

Systems may have a boundary, which defines the system because we can see what is inside and outside of the boundary. For example, humans have a skin which forms a boundary between them and the outside world, keeping infections out and our fluid contents in. Because social systems are often abstract, their boundaries are often harder to see, although their are exceptions such as countries and their borders. In many cases, the boundary is arbitrary, chosen to make our analysis easier.

Adaptive systems have a history. We often gain insight into what the system does today by looking into that history. In particular, the various interested parties’ interests are often in conflict, and understanding the history of how they protected  those interests helps to explain the current balance. Since they may have used deceit in protecting those interests, a careful look at that history may expose interests that are not what they claim them to be.

They may also have a fake history. Countries are an example; their history texts and stories told through the media are often fantasies which distort real history to hide unsavoury parts of their past. The diagram shows this as being invented by “interested parties”, such as governments or corporate executives.

We are seeing these remade now in the USA where State lawmakers are legislating against what they call “Critical Race Theory” but are specifically aimed at reshaping history by suppressing facts about racism. We also see it in the received history in the UK where Empire has always been taught as a Good Thing, bringing civilisation to the world, with no mention of the horrors of colonialism, enslavement and resource extraction among others things.

I hesitated several times over the phrase “interested parties”, because “interest” can mean merely curiosity. On the other hand, the original source for this diagram uses “stakeholder” which, when used in business contexts, often has the meaning of “those who have acquired a stake in the company” - derived from the use in gambling where your stake is the amount you have bet. However, the concept is intended to refer to anyone with an interest in the impacts of the system, such as the global public who have an interest in having clean air and a stable climate, which is affected by the emissions of corporations. We usually identify interested parties by their role, rather than as particular individuals.

In social systems, we also have to recognise that the interested parties in one role may be a part of the system in another role, which is one of the main reason that social systems thinking needs special care to ensure that the tools for generic systems thinking are applicable without change. This is represented on the diagram by the relationship “interested parties may have a role as a participant”. It is also important to investigate to what extent the interested parties are conscious of both the workings of the system and their roles within the system because that influences how likely they are to act as agents of change within the system. This is a particular distinguishing feature of social systems when compared with other complex adaptive systems.

Note the concept “Interest” which defines each of the distinct interests for each interested parties with respect to each system. For example, the public may have interests in a justice system that they are protected from criminal or civil harm, that they have fair hearings if they are accused within the system, that judgements are appropriate for harms caused and that the amount paid to maintain the system is in balance with the benefits of the system when compared with those of other uses of public money. On the other hand, some of the participants in that system, such as police, may have interests in growing their budget and power.

One particular type of concern of particular note is “purpose”. Contrary to some systems thinking books, systems do not usually have a single purpose. Purposes are conferred by people or by social institutions onto tools, including the systems they make. One person’s purpose for an iron may be to remove wrinkles from clothes; another person may use it to keep the door open.

For most voters, the purpose of a democracy may be to give them an equal say in decision-making, but for the wealthy, it may be to provide an illusion of that so that they can retain power in proportion to their wealth. This conflict, together with the history of eurocentric democracy which resulted from the struggle of the “lower orders” to wrest power first from the aristocracy and then from business owners, help us understand better why we have such an imperfect compromise which still mostly favours the rich. I will explore this in more detail later.

Other examples of interests are cost, safety and environmental impact.

Systems interact with their environment and vice versa (which is why the line linking system and environment has an arrow on both ends). Those environments can include the physical environment, such as when a corporation extracts minerals and dumps waste, or can include larger systems of which they are a part, such as when a corporation is part of a capitalist economy. Understanding these interactions are essential to understanding their behaviour and importance.
