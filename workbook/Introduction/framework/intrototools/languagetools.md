*“Words, Words, Words” — Hamlet.*

This workbook is nothing but words. Yet I hope it will produce some physical changes in me and cause my future actions to be different from what they would otherwise have been.

Although I have had some jobs where the main purpose was directly working on physical objects, most of my careers have been focused on the use of words: I have produced millions of them, strung together either to persuade someone to a course of action, to collaborate with people on decisions or for some similar purpose. Words are powerful. It is therefore worth understanding them better, not only their individual meanings, but the mechanisms by which they work.

I have found three ideas from my days of studying anglocentric philosophy to be very useful in that, although over the half-century since then, I have extended their meaning beyond that which I found in the writings of Wittgenstein and his followers. They are the ideas of meaning as use, language games and family resemblance. Wittgenstein proposed them in the context of solving (or dissolving) traditional philosophical puzzles, but I have applied them more to social issues. I may have distorted his intent but don’t really care as long as they work. We shall see in the course of this workbook.

Wittgenstein wrote:
>For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word "meaning" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.[ Philosophical Investigations §43.]

I take this to mean that each time a word is used, we should look at a combination of the dictionary meaning (which is a kind of average of how most people use the word), the context (“energy” means a different but related thing in a physics paper from everyday use, such as when I say “I have no energy today”) and finally, the particular use to which the particular user is putting it.

Take, for example, the word “communism”. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as
>A theory or system of social organization in which all property is owned by the community and each person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs

Among left-wing political theorists, you can expect to see it used in this sense, or even in a well-meaning discussion between persons trying to decide whether such communities are achievable or desirable.

There were a set of countries in eastern Europe whose governments were labelled as “communist”, although they usually described themselves as socialist, not as communist. They only called themselves communist in the sense that they believed that was a desirable goal, but claimed that they were merely a stepping stone; that the state would have to wither away before that was achieved.

However, “communist” is also used as a means to shut down discussion by labelling any position, argument or person as a communist, which is assumed to mean the actual condition of government under Stalin’s dictatorship, a condition under which nobody could reasonably want to live.

Three different uses with three different meanings:
1. To describe a possible future form of government,
2. To use it as an excuse to perform atrocities because they are the only way to defeat the enemies who stand in our way to a future ideal.
3. To shut down debate in the manner of shouting “bastard”, without any intention to make a factual claim about the point under discussion.

More recently, the political right-wing have taken to sneering at terms such as “social justice warrior” and “woke”. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, “woke” means
>alert to injustice and discrimination in society, especially racism [1960s: originally in African American usage]

These are examples of what I mean by language games. Not in the sense of “stop playing games, this is serious”, but in the sense of activities with rules that are understood by the “players”. This is strongly related to Wittgenstein’s notion of language games[ See, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)], though I suspect he did not have in mind quite the way I use it. As in these examples, he recalls that we use the same word in many different ways, akin to the idea that we can use the same ball to play different games with different rules.

His idea of family resemblance is based on the  idea that although members of a family may resemble each other in appearance or behaviour, it is not necessarily through a single trait. A and B may share the shape of their noses, while B and C may have the same hair colour. A and C may not necessarily have any feature in common.

In the same way, there is no feature that is common to all games. Some are formal and have well-defined rules, some are played just for fun and we may change their rules as we go. Some are played with balls and some with boards and some with no equipment required, like the street games I played as a child.

This can be misused. Our local general store is full of advertisements for lottery tickets. They contain many slogans intended to persuade you to buy them. Almost all of them use the word “game” or “play” to describe the act of saying “I’d like a [whatever] ticket” and handing over the money. At most you get to select a set of numbers to bet on. The resemblance to other games is very distant but intended to pretend that it’s fun to buy tickets and then imagine what you’d do with the winnings. In fact, the whole betting industry has been using the word “gaming” instead of “gambling” to emphasize the association with the fun of playing games at the expense of the association of gambling with debt  and ruinous loss of money.

Another game is that of argument or debate. What is the purpose of an argument? In Les Belles Images, Simone de Beauvoir uses the phrase "des arguments satisfaisants'' (satisfying arguments). What are those? Not necessarily arguments that are convincing to someone who is genuinely undecided, but perhaps arguments that you allow to convince you, because you want to believe the conclusion.
Debate is almost a literal game in school debating societies. Sometimes there is a vote by the audience or by judges to say who has won. The main moves are eloquence and powers of persuasion. There are sometimes expectations that the participants tell the truth, though it is rare that there are fact-checkers who deduct points.

On the CBC radio in Canada, there is even a show called “The Debaters” where they score points for “facts or funny”.

These are entertaining but unfortunately we have structured a lot of our legislative chambers on the same idea, which has a tendency both to elect people who are more entertaining than skilled in policy, and to actually determine policy on those grounds.

I have participated in a lot of meetings to decide policy, for governments at the civil service level and for corporations. They usually do not take the format of a debate. They follow other rules for allowing people with a wide mix of skills to discuss and arrive at agreement on policies which achieve the ends specified by the principles and requirements which were given as goals for the meeting or were arrived at by discussion, not debate, in the course of the meetings.

I add another tool to those I derived from Wittgenstein. I call it “aura analysis”. The idea is that when we hear words in context, they bring an aura of emotion and related meanings. Right-wing politicians rely on an aura of feelings of disgust and association with “dictatorship” and “economic disaster” to shut down discussion.
They use “taxpayers’ money” instead of “public money” to suggest that it is a kind of fee for services, taken without real consent, and not money to be used for the general good of society.

They use “freedom” to suggest that they are subject to onerous constraints instead being asked to exercise responsibility and accountability as members of society. They especially use “freedom of speech” to invoke a sense of human rights and to imply that shutting down hate speech or incitement to violence is somehow reprehensible instead of the opposite.
