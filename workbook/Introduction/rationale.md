## The world is in a mess

We are in the midst of a deadly pandemic, climate and biodiversity crises and the rise of fascism in some countries, but people are resisting the means to end them; we have an illegitimate political system which claims to be a democracy but excludes most people from most decisions, instead they are made by the rich and powerful in their own interests; we are continuing the genocide of Indigenous peoples, yet we white people are  in denial at best, or actively participating because we benefit from it; fascism is rising again;  we have more information and knowledge widely available than ever before, yet it is often behind pay-walls and overwhelmed by a flood of free misinformation, lies and propaganda, to name but a few of the inter-related set of crises.

This is the result of deliberate choices made by powerful people that are made in order to maintain their wealth and power, rather than to create systems that will provide a better life for most of us.

My main goals are to understand this by analyzing the dominant institutions of the eurocentric part of the world as systems as well as collections of individual people, with some thoughts about how we can change it. These goals — especially the second — can only be collaborative projects, so I would be happier if some other people read it, though it is also a form of collaboration to read other people’s work and to get some more general feedback on social media. 

This whole exercise is a rather grand ambition, but there are degrees of understanding; I am just trying to reach a level more than I have but within my grasp. And in Isaac Newton’s words, I am standing on the shoulders of giants, trying to understand things through the thinking tools that they have developed. It is mine only in the sense that their thoughts have been applied to my experiences and selected and interpreted based on that. It is perhaps only self-therapy, in which I try to hear the words of others as advice and counsel, and thereby bring myself some hope that things can get better. It is primarily for my own benefit, on the principle of “how do I know what I think until I see what I write?”[^fn1]. The act of writing forces me to be clearer and face my mistakes.

Many of the giants I wish to learn from are from oppressed minorities. They know far better than I do what the problems are, they have large bodies of learning on the struggles to change them and on alternative ways of structuring  systems of governance, collaboration, learning and more. 

Working through these workshops helps me to find ways to understand what they want to share, by opening my mind to other ways of thinking. I find that by writing things down, re-reading critically and reworking, I expose a lot of errors in my thinking. This removes false assumptions that I have somehow acquired and improves my understanding of the tools I use for the analysis. Sometimes ways of thinking that work well on a small scale do not work so well on a larger scale.

Regardless of where all my attitudes and beliefs came from, as I approach my third quarter century, it’s time for a major pruning before I lose the capacity

At this point in my life, I can no longer be as physically active in taking to the streets and I no longer have influence by being part of any organizations in which I have a say. I am isolated from physical communities because I live outside urban communities and recently even more so by the Covid-19 pandemic; I would like to move from my current rural location to a more urban one, but circumstances don’t permit it immediately.

I am publishing this workbook on my website as I go,  in case it is helpful to others and also in the selfish hope of getting some feedback to help me understand my errors. That may lead to some churn so I am delaying publication until I have written a set of related sections.

If you read any of this and have suggestions or are interested in a longer discussion, you can find me on social media through the header to all the pages.

Collaboration has two main benefits. The first is that two brains are better than one, the second is that for the more complex problems that face us, the thoughts of individual thinkers are of little value. They require more interdisciplinary, system-level thinking and acting than any individual is capable of, even if the individual makes no errors which is impossible.

As H.L. Menken said,

> For every complex problem, there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.

Unfortunately, those answers are easy for politicians to sell, so we need to arm ourselves against them. 

My view of the world is that we are social beings. That means that it is better both for ourselves and for others that we have to care for each other as individuals and that we design and cultivate the social systems we live in, in a way that allows everyone to thrive.

This is aimed at readers who recognize the injustice in the world and want to change that. 

It will be of no value to people who are strong supporters of populist politicians, who are anti-immigrant, who think Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ2S+  or any other group currently excluded from privileges are inferior or should give up their identity and assimilate or to anyone of similar beliefs. 

It won’t help you if you believe that individual rights trump all social needs or that your particular subset of humanity is somehow superior to others, whether that is based on some concept of race, gender, sex, religion, ability, nationality or similar attributes, I don’t intend to spend much time arguing that these beliefs are false; there is plenty of evidence that this is so. However, many of the discussions that follow will support this conclusion.

These exclusions are because experience suggests that people with these beliefs are too committed to their beliefs for it to be likely that they will change their minds, though I will eventually provide some reasons why, even by their own standards, they are wrong to hold these beliefs. Perhaps some will change their attitudes.

Many other people are doing more important work in organizing change, have far deeper knowledge than I do of particular situations and have developed or adapted their own thinking tools. I offer my collection of tools as something I have found useful so far and am developing further through writing this. They are yours to use, adapt or discard. Feel free to let me know if they are useful or not, through my Internet contact points. Even if this workbook is not useful for those doing the work, I hope that this will be of some use in encouraging people at least to avoid being obstacles to necessary change and perhaps even to learn enough to join the efforts to change things.

If you do find any of this useful, I guarantee you will find writings by people who have been marginalized by the power structures and accompanying personal attitudes in the dominant systems in the eurocentric world to be even more useful, including Indigenous, racialized, LGBTQ+, disabled and more. Their perspectives are more valuable than mine. I was not brought up to realize this, so I am still having to listen carefully, with both imagination and diligence to what they have to say, because my world-view tends to be self-perpetuating and reinforced by the systems I live in. Sometimes what I am told doesn’t fit with what I think I know at the time, so I have to take on trust for a while that it makes sense when I am able to change my perspective.

However, so far it has been worth the effort. I often feel uncomfortable to learn that I have been wrong, but it’s far better than continuing to be wrong.
