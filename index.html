	<h1>About This site</h1>
	<p>This site includes my blog, which will include philosophical thoughts, miscellaneous STEM thoughts and perhaps some photos of interest but will mostly
    be a discussion of the changes that I make to the workbook, to explain why I am making them (other than trivial changes and formatting)
	</p>
	<p>The main part of the work is the Philosophy Workbook, the other menu items should be obvious </p>
	<p>I am building the Workbook in Scrivener, my fovourite writing tool, which lets me export in Markdown or HTML, which needs only minor tweaking for this site.
		  I'll explain more of its structure once I have more content exported here  </p>
	<p> But what are you waiting for, skip to the <a href="/workbook/index.html">Workbook</a> right now</p>
