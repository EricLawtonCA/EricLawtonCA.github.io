	<h1>About This site</h1>
	<p>This site includes my blog, which will include philosophical thoughts, miscellaneous STEM thoughts and perhaps some photos of interest </p>
	<p>The main part of the work will be the Philosophy Workbook, the other menu items should be obvious </p>
	<p>I am building the Workbook in Scrivener. I'll explain more of it's structure once I have more content exported here  </p>
