My main purpose in creating this site is to publish my workbook on how we may understand the Eurocentric (Western) institutions that shape too much of the world and create a better future than the one we seem to be headed towards.

That is far to ambitious for me, but I limit it mostly to my thoughts about systems thinking applied to human social systems. The reason I am writing it and why it is possible you may want to read it is explained in detail in the [introduction](workbook/whywriting).

I find this difficult and can’t do it without writing it down — how do I know what I think until I see what I write[^fn1] — and perhaps someone will have some helpful guidance or criticism.

The site also includes a [blog](blog), which will mostly be a discussion of the changes that I make to the workbook, to explain why I am making them (other than trivial changes and formatting), as I find my mistakes and attempt to fix them. It will also include philosophical thoughts, miscellaneous STEM thoughts and perhaps some photos of interest.

The [About me](aboutme) section is intended to give some sense of who I am so that you know a little about why I have the perspectives that I do. I’m not sure that I will get round to a lot of detail, but I will probably put some anecdotes in the blog.

I welcome constructive input. I haven’t yet figured out how to add comments directly on this site — not a technical issue, each option has drawbacks -- so for now, please respond to my Twitter posts as I add each chapter, or just use the hashtag #EricsWorkbook. I realise not everyone uses Twitter or want to have an account, but other services like Disqus have their own drawbacks.
