#  Better Systems for Better Lives
## A Workbook in the Philosophy of Eurocentric Social Systems

This site contains [my workbook](workbook/index) on understanding the Eurocentric (Western) institutions that shape too much of the world and capturing ideas on changing them to implement a better future than the one we seem to be headed towards.

The reason I am writing it, and why it is possible you may want to read it, is explained in detail in the [introduction](workbook/whywriting) but, in summary, it is a record of my evolving opinions on our institutions such a countries, democracy and the economy, together with their components such as media, governments and education and health systems.

My opinions evolve as a result of writing it, on the principle of “How do I know what I think until I see what I write”[^fn1] and as a result of reading history, the news and many other sources.

As I do this, I am updating the book frequently and showing my work in the form of a [blog](blog), which will mostly be a discussion of the changes that I make to the workbook, to explain why I am making them (other than trivial changes and formatting), as I find my mistakes and attempt to fix them. It will also include philosophical thoughts, miscellaneous STEM thoughts and perhaps some photos of interest.

I am also hoping that perhaps someone else will have some interest in following along, both to learn something and perhaps offer some helpful guidance or criticism. Feel free to give suggestions on this, too.

The [About me](aboutme) section is intended to give some sense of who I am so that you know a little about why I have the perspectives that I do. I’m not sure that I will get round to a lot of detail, but I will probably put some anecdotes in the blog.

I welcome constructive input. I haven’t yet figured out how to add comments directly on this site — not a technical issue, each option has drawbacks ― so for now, please respond to my Twitter or Mastodon posts as I add each chapter. I realise not everyone uses Twitter or want to have an account, but other services like Disqus have their own drawbacks.
